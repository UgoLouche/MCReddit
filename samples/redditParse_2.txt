I get how Chaos Theory could link Chloe's survival in Blackwell to a massive superstorm due to a cascading anomaly in thermodynamics but how does it explain the extra weird shit like animals suddenly dying, random eclipses and double moons? They are quite literally impossible. How are they even remotely happening? Did a second moon just appear out of the blue in orbit and somehow NASA was unable to pick up on that?
/////////////////////
BOOM

I don't know why I just typed out boom without any sort of exclamation. With that being said talk about which character from LIS would you want to be as. For me I would love to be like Kate who in despite of having gone through so much crap. Was able to forgive the queen bitch which imo I am still kinda salty about. Who do you mostly align with?
/////////////////////
After finishing ep 5 and after the depression I began to think if the did make a season 2 who would it be about and where would it be if they didn't make new characters that is. I began to think about where and the most likely was either seattle or back in Arcadia Bay after that I thought about who in the where(Ha). If it was in seattle it could be Mr.Jefferson doing a psychopathic rampage around town, but I thought about if it was in Arcadia bay and if so who would it be I IMMEDIATELY thought of Rachel and I became (very) obsessed with the idea of Rachel and how she would fit in the story (aside from the main plot of Life is strange) and what if she had time powers to (in the thought of the vastness of the universe and the infinity that it and that there are cross dimensional realities there is a chance that she could have powers to) like Maxine. In the main story a deer/doe is spotted twice (I think) in the junkyard (where her corpse is found) and the and most direct exposure was is in the rewind sequence in ep 5, I have figured out (What I believe at least) that the deer/doe is the spirit of Rachel guiding you to where she was buried(sorry to cut away again but the butterfly is Chloe I believe because it is there when she gets shot and if you sacrificed her where she was buried just saying to get it out of the way) so the game could take place between when Max leaves for seattle (age 13) and returns 5 years later but I haven't thought about what the plot would be (yet), but the possibility is there so if you guys (the community) wanna take a crack at that mystery be my guest, but please comment (I love reading the theories and stories and explanations no matter how long). Thanks for reading.   
/////////////////////
First off, this is the [Main Theme](https://youtu.be/QRqoOmI0_is) of Life is Strange. Its the one that first plays when you load up the game in the main menu. 


Its great, but that's not what I' am referring to. On a PS4 (it may be on other consoles, I have no idea), you know how you can scroll down on any game and bring up a pop up menu? They usually have achievements listed, DLC, screenshots, videos, fanclub stuff, etc. Anyways, some games don't have music on that screen, others do. 


LIS in this instance does, but its different. Its similar to the main theme, EXCEPT that its a bit slower, seems to have a way heavier bass effect, a ton of reverb (I think that's the term), and the higher pitched guitar strumming along in the background (which you hear in the Main LIS Theme) is gone.


I think it sounds AMAZING. Especially if you just pop in a pair of good headphones and lay back to chill out. I just get goosebumps listening to it. Its kind of dark and ominous, but I dunno I just love it. I listen to it all the time when I am bored at home. The problem is that, I haven't seen that version of the main theme posted anywhere on the internet. I'd love to download it and put it on my phone, but at the moment it doesn't seem possible. Like unless I buy a capture card for my PS4, I don't see another way of obtaining it.


So I guess there's three questions here.

1) Have you heard it before?

2) Do you know where I can find it online

3) If you have a capture card could you record like five minutes and post it to Youtube? :D
/////////////////////
Hey guys,
I just beat the game last week, and I have been wanting to play it again but I think it might be too soon? I was wondering how long you all waited before you played again?
/////////////////////
It all happened some time ago when I saw a gameplay of the game showing that Max had rewind powers, I immediately stopped the video because I knew that this game had some potential and it would be awesome if I played it myself rather than watching people do it.After a year or so I found out that my brother bought it in the steam summer sale and I could played it using steam family sharing.

First time I played it was in the school days so I didn't have too much time to dedicate on this slow-paced game (I read all the diary and tried to talk to everyone so that I could dive into the Arcadia Bay everyday life for a little longer).
Then this summer I resumed my journey and I finished the game.
This was one of the most emotional games I've ever played and now I can't stop remembering the amazing story of Max and Cloe,friends beyond time.

Every time that the soundtrack plays in my head I have a deep feeling of sadness that I can't stop.

Feel free to add comments below about your thoughts for the story and how you feel after completing it
/////////////////////
It's been so long now since I finished LIS and I've wanted to get a tattoo about it for a long time also. This would be my first. I was thinking of having Max and Chloe back to back (faces) with Chloe's tattoo behind them but a shorter version to fit with them along with the quote of "Don't you forget about me". Also would adding a blue butterfly in be too much? What do you guys think?
/////////////////////
In episode one (before Chloe gets shot) Max gets verbally humiliated in class, takes the selfie yata yata, until she gets to the bathroom to where and when Chloe gets shot and Max gains her powers BUT through the game you are constantly told that when something happens(like in EP3 in Blackwell) you can move and rewind time and "teleport" to a new location to change history SO when Max gets her powers WHY and HOW did Max really teleport back to the Photography classroom without moving? I think that Max's powers are way more powerful than we are shown and that she can see into the future, that's just what I think tho.
/////////////////////
If Chloe was "Meant to die" then why would the universe trying to kill her end with the destruction of Arcadia Bay and a tornado? What's to say a Tsunami won't happen at the next town? Or an earthquake? Or another Tornado?

Are Max and Chloe just going to keep skipping from town to town until the world gets destroyed?
/////////////////////
Hello there,

We do weekly streams on https://www.twitch.tv/bossastudios of our games and tomorrow we're doing something a little bit different. We're starting a sporadic series where we play games that some Bossa employees have previously worked on and we're starting with Remember Me. 

So, if you'd like to watch, head to our Twitch channel at 5pm BST / 9am PDT / July 21st and enjoy this little insight into Remember Me.

Thought this might be of interest to some of you Dontnod fans. Apologies if I'm breaking any rules or anything like that. That's not my intention at all! 

Cheers!
/////////////////////
After getting through the end of LIS I was pretty fucked up. I had to sacrifice Chloe as the morally correct thing to do and I felt like screaming and slamming on my keyboard after the game ended. This game has taught me that there is more than meets the eye of people, even closest people, and sometimes, you have to make sacrifices for the greater good, but damn, I will never forget this. TYSM SQUARE ENIX AND DONTNOT FOR A GREAT GODDAMN GAME...
/////////////////////
I failed you guys...

Tried to save Kate, but she just jumped from the roof.

I know I can't repeat it on this play through, but I'll do better by you next time Kate...I promise. 

Goddamn. :'(

/////////////////////
I have just finished ep 5 (SCREW Mr. Jefferson) so can i just say when I first fell in love with the game (in ep 1) I could not walk away I enjoyed the ups and the downs I especially brokedown in ep 4 (I chose yes btw) and at the end of ep 5 ( I saved Chloe I COULD NOT end her again) afterwards I fell into a deep depression about how I wouldn't see how Max and Chloe went on afterwards (EXTREME PRAYING for season 2 if they are making one) and the choices I made in the story, but most importantly I will never be able to experience all of those emotions (crying and sadness) with the same power behind them, but I was able to recover at least enough to function in normal life. To sum up a long and heartfelt story I love the game, hope for season 2, and finally thank you the fan base, the people who make original content, songs ect. and I hope to post more here and have a great day thanks for reading. p.s. if anyone has any news on season 2 at all please comment.

Now, it is time to turn our attention back to what we liked/disliked about our favorite characters. 

Today's character to empathize or send to the pits of hell is Nathan Prescott. Some of you may remember him as the shit head that was one of the main things that ruined any sort of fantasy we wished would/could happen.

Who am I? I should count myself lucky it's one thing
I still remember. My name is Maxine Caulfield. Max
to my friends. My story is tragedy. Right now as I sit
here writing this I am dead. But i'm also not. It's...
Complicated. Let's start at the beginning if there can be
said to have one.


It seems an aeon ago I lived in Arcadia Bay but due to my
father's work. And an unpleasant incident of which I won't
go into. I was forced to move to Seattle. Fast Forward five
years and I was back home but with a different set of eyes.


Going back I went to Blackwell Academy for Pretentious Aspiring 
Artists. As you can imagine I fit right in at home. I always hid
behind a camera lens. Taking pictures of life instead of living it.
If only I had known how short life was...


You see one fateful day. I was in class. Having a vision of a terrible
storm. A storm that would come to destroy the town but in the future.
I didn't understand what I was seeing and I awoke taking a selfie.
Because sleeping through a famed photography professor's class wasn't
tempting fate enough.


As you can imagine, The eye of Sauron turned on me. And after a humiliating
display of my lack of knowledge I went off to the bathroom to wash away the shame.
While I was in there I saw a blue butterfly and decided to photograph it. That's when
Nathan Prescott came in talking to himself like the poor insane bastard he is. 


Then came her my blueberry goddess. At the time I didn't recognize her. See her name
Is, Was, And will be Chloe Price. When I saw her last five years prior she had been a
happy smiling blonde. But because of her father's death happiness was left bleeding in the
gutter of her mind. With Rage as the new Mayor, Police Chief, and Mob Boss. I watched Nathan
shoot her in the stomach and I reached out and rewound. 


I was back in the classroom and began using my power for my own gain. Looking like the Class Genius
instead of the Class Dumbass. I went to the bathroom rang a fire alarm and Chloe got the fuck out of
dodge. I came out when the coast was clear. I came out of course then I had to talk to the Principal.
I could have ratted Nathan out then again I could also lie and pretend I was just startled.


Lying worked best then. Some truths are best left concealed. And the judgment of an authority figure
with no true authority meant little to me. So I began toying with my craft. I was suddenly an expert
on Drones, knew skater lingo, and a master of photographic history. Though to be fair I knew the last
offhand. After using Chronomanipulation as it's called to whitewash the school alpha bitch, Victoria.
I continued my spree and found out about an pregnancy and subsequent not so pregnant anymore one of
my friends had. 


I then had to take a flash drive out to the parking lot for my friend Warren the Stalker with a crush
and the science knowledge ahead of his own time. Then Nathan Prescott attacked Warren being the knight
he is tried to fight him off and Lady Chloe the Blue pulled up in her truck. We caught up and the 
moment I saw her face I turned into a cartoon character, hearts in my eyes. My chest bulging out with
each heartbeat clearly defined. Tapping my leg like a rabbit. You know the cliches.


We got to her place and I discovered her Stepfather was a surveillance obsessed kind of a dick veteran
turned school security officer. I took the blame for Chloe's Marijuana. In actuality I was never much
of a smoker. Even back in Seattle I preferred eating Pot. Not just in brownies as some assume. You
can just swallow it down as if it were kale or some other healthy plant. 


Chloe showed me her gun and we snuck out to go to the lighthouse where my vision kicked in again of
the storm. But Chloe was there and I told her everything and then the snow fell on an eighty degree
day in summer. Then I went back to the dorms. Began doing some research on Time Travel. Did alot of
it actually. When it got really late I had an intimate session with some fantasies of Chloe. Then I
drifted right to sleep.


The Next morning I woke up and decided to take a shower. Hygiene is important after all. So while i'm
cleansing my body and mind of all the troubles in came Victoria and she was harassing Kate over a
video taken while Kate was impaired after Kate left Victoria wrote the URL on the mirror but I erased
it. I had to get dressed and bring Kate a book I borrowed and that's when I found out she was drugged.


I kept my cool telling her she should talk to police. Though in actuality I wanted to take Nathan to
the school pool, hit him in the back of the head with a pipe and let him drown. And that was me being
merciful. But ultimately we went with plan talk to the police and I went off to Two Whales to meet my
Aphrodite. Chloe was as giddy as a kid on christmas or me the one time we were playing truth or dare
and she dared me to kiss her. Though at the time I played it off ironically it wasn't the last time
she dared that. But i'm getting ahead of myself. 


After a display of my powers which to the naked eye just looked like precognition. We went to the
Junkyard for firing practice. There was some business with finding bottles I never want to think about
and then firing practice with her trusty handgun. It was my turn when Frank our friendly neighborhood
pusher man showed up. I pulled the trigger on the empty gun at him needless to say he was not very
pleased. And then I had to save Chloe from a damn train.


So I head back to school and Kate wasn't there turns out she was up on the roof ready to jump off
and kill herself. So I froze time which was a neat trick. I managed to talk her down because I was a
true friend through everything she had been going through. I noticed her pain and sadness and was
there unlike ninety percent of the sympathetic susans and caring calebs that came out the woodwork 
afterwards. Still she was saved. 


I had to name someone as being the tipping point and something in my gut told me it was my own professor
Mark Jefferson. Maybe it was the hipster glasses, maybe it was the stupid goatee, maybe it was even
the way he somehow managed to fake being a fake. I mean the whole "I'm hip and with it" everyone knows
hip and with it aren't even a thing. But by pretending he didn't know it wasn't a thing he escalated
his own doucheyness. But mostly it was "Methinks she doth protest too much" when I expressed my concerns.


A girl was drugged and possibly raped and your response is basically "She had it coming"? That set all
of my alarm bells off. So instead of a fun night of dreaming of Chloe in a domme outfit. I had a
nightmare of watching Kate , Chloe, Dana, Stella, Brooke, and Alyssa kill themselves in various ways.
Kate's was the one who woke me up at my desk. And that's when Chloe texted me and it became Ninja time.


I talked with the only two people still up and about. Which so happened to be Victoria's leashed cronie
Taylor who was having an anxiety attack and Dana who was generally out of sorts. Both let me know Vic
had snuck out too. So I snuck into Victoria's room and did some snooping. It was harmless. It all was
so harmless. 


So I went to meet Chloe and we found Victoria practically with her panties around her ankles for Professor
Asshole. And he sent her away like a beaten dog. A horrible analogy but apt. And we broke in looking
for evidence. After more chronomancy, Some homemade explosives courtesy of my friend Warren's brains,
and A scouring of the Principal's office we found records about Me, Nathan, Chloe, Kate, and Rachel
Amber.


Ugh Rachel Amber. I don't begrudge her for filling the void in my absence. But to mislead my beloved.
Or perhaps Chloe mislead herself. Still you have no idea how hard it hurts a human heart when you watch
someone you want with every fiber of your being, when that person is in love with another. It eats at
you but I digress. Nathan's notes were evidence that he was involved with Rachel's Disappearance.


So we took ourselves a nice little swim in the school pool as a reward for our espionage tactics. 
After stealing money from the Handicapped fund. I should regret it but time erases regrets. Anger
however is fueled by time. Watching Chloe strip down to her bra and panties. I tried not to salivate
as I joined her. She wouldn't notice as I was very good at keeping things close to the chest.


So we went to her place after dodging security and went to bed together though still not in the way i'd
prefer we were very... chloriney. So the next morning when I showed up at breakfast. I used Chloe as
a distraction to investigate David aka Chloe's Paranoid Stepdad in case I forgot to share his name's
files. And they were extensive. However when he came home he and Chloe had a fight.


I love Chloe with my very soul but that does not always make her right. So for once I told her to stop.
David is a veteran and probably has PTSD. Chloe was not happy but i'm used to that. We headed back to
the diner in an attempt to find evidence about Rachel from Frank. I had to use more guile. But in the
end he practically gave me his keys. And we broke in tossing a bone to distract his dog Pompidou into
the parking lot.


The photos and letters hidden inside his RV did not sit well with Chloe and she began driving me back
to the School where she was a powder keg of rage both for Rachel Amber's deception and she
was mad at her birth father, William for dying. We parted less than amicably and while in my dorm 
I found a way to jump into a photograph andalter history.


I went back to the day Chloe's father died and through means of guile I save him. But Fate is a cruel
fickle bitch who always gets what she wants. Kind of like Victoria at times. And when I returned home
I found out I was now besties with Victoria and Nathan. But worse than that or the mysterious absence
of Kate in this Max's life. I found Chloe a quadrapalegic.


Can you imagine the sheer horror that one has when they discover they have utterly destroyed what they
love most in this world? Now times that by ten and you'll have a glimmer of what I felt when Chloe asked
me to Euthanize her. But I love her I have always loved her. I will always love her. So I did what she
wanted though a part of me died with her. I did it and then I went back and I let William die.


Back in time we had to investigate leads which meant going to Frank which ended up with a heart to heart.
He loved Rachel as much as I love Chloe and gave us the information we needed. We also went to the school
where we broke into Nathan's room and stole his cellphone. He attacked us in the hall but Warren came
and went ape on his face. I rewatched that beatdown dozens of times.


Ultimately I stopped warren and Nathan swore vengance. Me and Chloe followed the evidence to a bunker
that had photographs of Kate and Rachel and many many others. We found pictures showing Rachel being
buried in the Junkyard and rushed there to find out the truth. Noone should have to die like that.
We found her and I was there when Grief turned to Rage. All things turn to Rage in time. She vowed to
kill Nathan and we went to the end of the world party. I made up with Victoria despite everything and
even told her to avoid Nathan but I couldn't know.


We got a text that Nathan was destroying the evidence but when we got there it was a trap. I was drugged
and Chloe, my Chloe, died once more. And the killer none other than Jefferson. When I awoke he was in
full Supervillain mode. Spouting his Hannibal Lecture. But I used my power to jump through time. I 
created a world where he was in jail and I won the big photo contest and went to display my works. But
the storm came and I was forced back to reality. That's when an old joke happened. 


A professor in a classroom spoke to his class. "God doesn't exist!" he announced. "And I shall prove
it. If God exists may he strike me down." He called out boldly. A marine standing in the hallway calmly
walked into the classroom cocked back his fist and knocked the professor on his ass. "What was that for"?!
The professor exclaimed. "God was busy so he sent me." The marine answered.


In case you were wondering David was the marine and with a little help he kicked the shit out of Professor
Psychotic and freed me. When I told him Chloe was dead he blew Jefferson's brains out. I was beyond caring.
I knew I had one chance. I had to get to Warren because he had a photo of me and Chloe before the
junkyard. I had to brave the storm and saved my classmates and other citizens. But I did it. I went
back.


Me and Chloe didnt go to the junkyard, the cops got Jefferson, Nathan was already dead by Jefferson's hand.
All that was left for the storm. I had to battle my psyche to get to the lighthouse. But in the end I
was given a choice. Go back in time and let Chloe die in that bathroom or watch Arcadia Bay be destroyed.
It wasn't even a choice. I saved my beloved and we left the wreckage. With what money she had left we
got a hotel room and some alcohol we decided to ravage each other before worrying about guilt. 


Years I had been waiting for that and I went to sleep with the taste of my lover on my lips. And then
I woke up in the classroom. On the exact same day as this all started. I made changes but no matter what
I always wake up back there. I've killed myself a million times. I've Killed Jefferson a billion. I've
had Chloe sometimes with Kate sometimes with Victoria. Once we even let Warren join in. I've lived these
days over and over for an eternity. And the one thing I have never done is given up on Chloe. Maybe in
a millenia I will. Maybe. But for now i'll relive them knowing that for all the pain i'll endure I have
her. She is my reason to be and the reason I am. I thought you might want to know this because well...


You won't remember it.
/////////////////////
Hello, I am in the process of writing a fan-fiction but I've run into a bit of a pickle when it comes to Max's powers. I'm hoping you guys can help clear something up for me.

Has it ever been made explicitly clear, either during the game or through interviews with the developers/VAs, whether Max's powers "re-write" a single timeline or whether they cause the current timeline to split / jump to a new timeline?

Personally, I feel like with the way the game actually works it heavily implies that her powers work on a kind of "Back to the Future" basis, where there is really only one timeline and changes in the past will re-write the present.

However, I do not know if any of the devs have ever volunteered any additional information on the topic; if so, I would love to hear what they have to say because the answer to this question has a heavy impact on how I approach the story I'm writing.
/////////////////////
Only on the second episode and already, there is so much tension between these two! 

Seriously y'all...I shipped the *fuck* out of these two already...

/////////////////////
You get over it by doing something else. Play more games, watch different anime series or movies. In your current state it feels like it won't help but it actually does. I know it from experience. And it's the same common advice given for people suffering with breakups. It works.

The problem with human brains are that they act completely based on what they feel and believe. Usually when people give you advice, it's something you just hadn't though of before. You have found the solution. Your perception has changed and you act according to it.

In some other cases, you don't really know if it would work. You don't yourself actually know it would work, but because someone else is suggesting it, you think that maybe it would work. Then you do it and realize it worked.

In difficult cases like this, you actually feel like knowing if a solution would work or not. This is your perception, your reality. Even if other people try to say otherwise, you know how it works and act according to it. But it's a false perception, and this is one of the most mindblowing weakness we have, I might even say this is one of the core problems of depression: People really act only based on their beliefs alone. If they don't believe a solution they are offered would work, they won't do it. Now, you might disagree, saying that people DO try things they don't believe working. Actually not. It's just that in that case they DO have a very slight hunch of being wrong themselves and the idea being right.

In depression, if you don't try what psychologists suggest, nothing can be done about it. If you absolutely "know" it won't work, you just don't do it. They can't really force you to try. You can only do it yourself. There are countless number of people having been behind this kind of impenetrable wall for years or even their whole life, having not found anything that would have made an opening to this wall, a slight doubt of being wrong, a slight change given to advice they have "known" to be useless. Hopefully understanding this would make an opening and make you try something.

In fact you really haven't gone through a logical process and concluded it wouldn't work, because in emotional matter it's impossible. You haven't properly tried either, or haven't tried enough times; not all solutions work right away. So you can't really know. But your intuition says it wouldn't work. On the other hand, other people's experiences show that it works.

---

I still remember how awesome this game was and how big impact it had on me for a long time, but doesn't feel like that big deal anymore. The reason it seems difficult for people in this sub find solution for getting over it is probably because the ones that have gotten over it don't visit this sub anymore. Me neither. I just happened to come see how it was going here nowadays.
/////////////////////
As stated, just finished this on Sunday and feel gutted. Haven't felt depression since I got on a light dose of meds a few years ago, and haven't felt 'feels' in even longer.



I don't even know where to begin because it was just a massive experience for me, there are many thoughts and surprisingly the 'I wish it wouldn't end' isn't one of them.



I sacrificed Arcadia Bay, because I didn't feel like more time travel wad the answer to this, especially with the dreaded photo method: My stomach sank when Max ended up back in Jefferson's dark room with her journal burnt up after diving into her photo at the gallery. Combine that with the nightmare and it was kind of a no go in my mind, and I presume Max's. Just 'stop trying to fix things, save things, whatever is in front of me right now is fine.' That combined with the concept of leaving Chloe for dead with no memory of the journey was too much. It may have a bit to do with my general feelings about time travel.



Anyway, I'm stuck with a storm of thoughts. I had always kind of wanted to get I to photography, because much like Max I tend to observe things and take in surroundings. I feel that more profoundly than ever, but have never been satisfied with the results I get with phones, and am not sure how to get into either proper digital or film. 



That and probably the more identifiable concern of 'where does one find a girl/friend like Max/Chloe/favoriteCharacter?' My social circle is pretty non-existent, and it's only been harder since I moved up to North Carolina(job market is great at least).



Blah blah I could go on forever and there's already several topics on this today. :X



(I'm also new to Reddit so let me know if I screwed up anything..)

So, I dowloaded the other episodes for life is strange for PS3. I cannot find any information for the problem I'm having all information I do find is from when they first came out and basically the answers are just it might not be on the pan network and stuff but I digress.

I downloaded the episodes, they appear under "game" in the main menu of the PS3, but when I open the game I can't play the new episodes is ether says coming soon or download. If I select continue game it says the episodes are not installed. If I select the dowloaded episodes in the main PS3 menu it just gives me information about them but doesn't let me play. I'm so confused, how do I install them!!

Please help

Edit: solved: if you are having this problem you need to exit the game completely then go to the game menu and select the episode it's self it will start to install hope this helps someone else I spent 3 days on this mess.

From my perspective and my opinion only Sacrifice Chloe Ending is much much more emotional and depressing than Save Chloe Ending

For Non-Hardcore and Casual gamers would hate this game if they chose Save Chloe Ending (ex. Jacksepticeye he liked the game, but he hated the ending because he chose Save Chloe Ending and reacted horribly and made him hate the game), As it really doesn't give you closures or the happiness (Sacrifice Chloe Ending provides you the satisfaction of knowing that everyone is alright and the Butterfly, need i say more), Sacrifice Chloe would distract them from hating the game, because they are busy flowing rivers of tears, and hours of depression and PLiSD.

It's similar to great movies with sad/depressing endings makes you hate movie, even though it is beautiful. Sorry for the godawful English, I just.... I have less brain cells than average person and an IQ of a 6 year old.

Hey all,

I finished this game last night. It took me well over a year because I found ep 1 and 2 really slow. Then ep 3 happened, and I didn't stop until it was 3am and I'd made my final choice on ep 5. (then promptly YouTubed the other one). 

I see a lot of theories and discussion on this sub, and it's really nice. For me though? I had a feeling I've not had for the longest time; the one you get when you finish a truly good book. 

I know well enough to leave it alone when I get this feeling, and the game really was an emotional one for me. The first I've had for the longest time. 

For me, it really was the affirmation that I've recovered. That I can feel emotions and am not afraid to do so. 

Just to add, in case you're wondering what the hell I'm rambling about, a lot of stuff happened, and I was convinced that I had become broken, emotionally. I'm talking about watching Grave of the Fireflies and not feeling a single thing kind of broken. 

Since that time, things have gotten better, but still I barely felt anything. 

But recently, after 4/5 years, I'm healing. I went to a Zelda concert and I cried. I look at my gf, now fiancé, and I feel joy overwhelming. I watch films and laugh. 

And now that I played this beautiful game, it's reminded me that I'm still human, and whether I was broken or not before, I'm definitely not now. 

Thank you, Dontnod for this poignant journey. It's simultaneously given me closure, fun, and some of the most enjoyable hours of my life.  

Not sure why I felt the need to share all of that, it just felt right. 


Life is strange.... 

Tl;Dr: used to feel no feels, thought I would never again, recently started to, game affirmed it in very tangible way.

Hi guys,
just to share this article (from the French journal "Le Monde").

It doesn't inform much, excepting the anecdote concerning the fan initiative to develop a season 2, quickly disrupted by Square. Nevertheless, it concludes suggesting that the Dontnod team could create a season 2.

Have a nice day.

When you start looking for the tools to fix your camera and Santa Monica dream played. 

The song fit with being reunited with Chloe, the time of day, the mood. Everything was just connected. 
/////////////////////
First off, I chose to save the bay instead of Chloe. Before even finishing this episode I accidentally spoiled the final choice for myself, so I went in with my mind set on saving Chloe. But, there's something about Chloe's final speech at the lighthouse that got to me.

Chloe said that Max's powers weren't for nothing, so I thought that Max was given her powers to spend one last week with her, that no matter how many times Max saved Chloe, she ended up dead in some way. Max is able to cherish spending time with Chloe for the last time before she has to die. I mean, can you imagine if Max wasn't given the power to rewind, then finding out that it was her childhood friend that died being shot in Blackwell, the one friend she didn't talk to for 5 years? Damn.

So I basically made the tough decision by seeing things from Chloe's point of view instead, and it makes a lot of sense to me. If it's time for me to go, I'll need to accept my fate, plus, I can't bear the thought of sacrificing the whole town just so I could live.

It wasn't easy deciding though, I was sobbing so hard while saying "I'm sorry Chloe, I've to let you go" over and over to myself loudly that I half expected my dorm mates to come knocking on my door to ask if I was okay(they didn't though haha) 

Now I can't even listen to Spanish Sahara without breaking down in public. It's just ugh my heart hurts a lot after that ending, thought it was beautiful though, I lost it again when that blue butterfly landed on Chloe's coffin.

I want to do a second playthrough where I'll save Chloe instead to save myself from emotional devastation.

p/s: I really freaked out because of how much I saw myself in Chloe, which is why I sided with her all the time instead of thinking of the consequences of siding with her in those decisions involving Chloe o_0
/////////////////////
Taking a little break from the like/dislike topics and going with something different. I don't even really have to explain how this topic connects with the game. If you don't see how the two are related than I question if you really are a fan.

With that being said are you a hipster? Has playing LIS made you realize how much of a hipster you are? Are compelled to further your hipster ways?

Hello, i just finished Life Is Strange about two weeks ago and i still can't get over the game's ending(yes, i cried at the end lel).
The story and the characters of this game is literally unforgettable, not to mention the soundtrack is really catchy and filled with a lot of emotions put into it.
I also love the artistic style approach towards the game's graphics.
Voice acting is great too, i have to give credit to Ashly Burch for voicing my favorite girl Chloe(She voiced Tiny Tina from Borderlands 2 and Miss Pauling from TF2 as well!)
Then, i just got into reddit more recently and i decided to join this lovely community
I love seeing this small community doing things together even though most of us has already finished the game.
Anyways, someone please link me any Chloe and Max Twitter banner(but please don't give me any Pricefield stuff)

I'm still quite new to reddit so i might suck a bit at starting discussions, I hope you guys understand why my post looks a bit meh.... 
This is also my first ever post i ever typed on reddit so try to look through my post for spelling mistakes.

Hey you guys. Life is Strange is such a unique game, and I expect its players to have unique stories and experiences with it as a result.

I won't say that Life is Strange is my absolute favorite game of all time. That belongs to Fallout: New Vegas. But Life is Strange got me through the hardest breakup of my life, and it's still one of my favorite games. When I couldn't feel anything, I turned to this game. The end of chapter 2 (not gonna spoil anything) caused me to break down into tears and seek help for my depression. It's definitely one of the most immersive and emotional experiences I've ever had in a video game.

I think starting the game after a breakup is what makes it special to me. I remember my daily ritual at the time. I'd brew a cup of kava stress relief tea and sip on it as I explored Arcadia, letting myself feel however I needed to feel at the time. I was already in the emotional gutter, and the game helped me cope with my feelings in a way. It reconnected me to my own humanity in a way that no other video game did, especially at a time that I needed it. The music in this game definitely what I'll take from it the most, for sure.

Honestly, I was looking forward to Fallout 4 more than anything last year, but Life is Strange provided me with the catharsis that I needed to get out of bed, go to work, and pretend to be okay during a time when I needed it most. No other game has done that for me, and I felt like sharing my story here.

This [camera mod](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/808518/pc-games/life-is-strange-camera-mods-useful-for-screenshots/) allows me to view scenes at different camera angles, but it also has some really neat side-effects that I thought you guys would like.
[Here, in the scene in episode 1 where David barges into Chloe's room, I hid in the closet.](http://imgur.com/a/puh52) Turns out that the closet technically isn't an area that is part of  the map because you never explore it in that scene, Max just hides in it. When I look at Max with the mod it just looks really weird. I then walked forward a little bit and she fell through the map! She just kind of fell until she disappeared and the sky looked weird, it wasn't very interesting.

Back in February, French school ENS organized a panel with co game directors of Life Is Strange. [Today in July, it is available!](http://savoirs.ens.fr/expose.php?id=2596) (in French)

I wrote what was planned to be « some lines showing mostly the main ideas of the talk ». Prepare some tea and cookies. The conversation is led by Alexis Blanchet, Docent at University Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle specialized in the links between cinema, TV shows and video games. In fact, I based a lot of the text of [his own live tweet of the event](https://twitter.com/AlexisBlanchet/status/694829723298480128). I tried to put themes in that 1.5 hours talk while keeping a linear flow. If something requires more details / correction, do not hesitate!

Good reading.

***

**Beginning and prototype**

The discussion opens with Michel and Raoul with the links between Life Is Strange (LIS) and Remember Me (RM). Both worked on RM. Hervé Bonin, one of the five cofounders of DONTNOD wanted to stretch the idea of the memory remix into an entire game. There was also a wish to extend the importance of environmental storytelling. RM has a lot but in the end, you were always running and missing all of them. 

[The first memory remix of RM (spoilers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbANyg8Z16o)

The very first prototype of the game is a scene with Nilin from RM. She is in a room, a ball breaks a window. She rewinds and opens the window in order to let the ball enter in the room. They kept the idea with the bird in EP1. 

At first, this is a small team (Michel is in it, Raoul joined later) working one day a week while RM is almost done and other prototypes of bigger games are emerging. This is a project that was supposed to be independent / auto funded in parallel of another bigger game (RM2 or another AAA IP I guess). It was then presented to publishers due to the financial condition of DONTNOD (the studio entered in financial restructuration in January of 2014). Most of the time publishers were more interested by LIS than the other AAA games the company had to present. The themes of teenage years, regrets and testing your choices come quickly in place and are built in the same time as the writing of the characters and settings. Max was written with that in mind: A shy character who is afraid to move on and becoming an adult. What happen if someone like her has the power to play with time? 

There are 9 months between the idea of the game / project and the first playable prototype (FPP) shown to publishers. The prototype is the one in the Director Commentary (Chloe’s room) and it focuses on environmental story telling and puzzles. It is on that FPP that Square Enix will sign on the project and it will be decided it will be an episodic game. On that, Raoul says that they wanted to do an episodic game but I’m pretty sure I’ve read that Square asked for it in order to give the format a try since they had no game in this particular format (now we’ve got Hitman, Final Fantasy VII Remake, …). A few commentaries about the UI which breaks 4th wall and shows to the player how Max is: She writes everything in a journal that the player reads, the interactive elements in game are done like if it was Max writing notes on everything, … 

***

**Time travel and paradoxes**

Back to the rewind, Alexis Blanchet talks about the paradoxes of the rewind in the game. The main one is that, in LIS, time and space are separated. Basically, when she rewinds, Max teleports herself. The team thought of acknowledging it directly in the game with NPC being surprised to see Max magically appearing with an exclamation / incomprehension coming from them but dropped it because acknowledging it in the game would have brought more problems than the ones they fixed.

So the team is of course aware of the paradoxes or diegetic narrative inconsistencies that inevitably produces the rewind. To quote Raoul: « During all the production, there wasn’t a morning where I wasn’t telling myself let’s just get rid of the rewind ». After a lot of talks, back and forth and tries, they just decide to assume the inconsistencies based on a balance between story and game, even if that means being criticized on that. The game has to be fun above all. As example, they say that with a « coherent rewind », all puzzles would have been only based on discussion (*I know something, I rewind and use that information*) and there wouldn’t be puzzles based on interactions (getting the keys in EP3 for example). Same logic behind the fact that Max keeps objects when rewinding: Having to get them back everytime would not be fun to play. It has to be easy to use. They assume players will accept it while playing because the rewind is fun enough, even if some will second guess it after playing the game.

The conversation about paradoxes then focuses on Max herself and Alexis Blanchet tells the power negatively impact her since she is presented as a shy character but then act like a « nasty little hypocrite » when she plays with the rewind. He takes as example the paint bucket in EP1 where she can confort Victoria, but Max is totally responsible for the situation. The mechanics is going against a written character depicted as honest and caring. She becomes in fact sneaky and manipulative. The team admits it and it is in fact something they want the player to think of: The use of the power and the consequences on your surroundings. It was discussed here few months ago here with a quote of Michel Koch telling that Max was not as good as she thought she was while using the rewind (and led to a stupid shitstorm of people pissed about it, but hey!)


***

**Working with Square Enix**

About the FPP, as you can see on the [concept art](http://i.imgur.com/D77qqm4.jpg), the flag is originaly tagged and tattered. Square US is worried about the reception of that and ask to chill a bit (mostly legal stuff: It appears you are only authorize to flip the flag, deteriorating it is forbidden). They just kept the reversed flag as a sign of rebellion. There will be a lot of discussion about sensitive subjects (rape, homosexuality, bullying) and talks with legal teams of Square about stuff like the design of some elements (truck of Chloe, keyboard and HiFi) that looked too much like real branded objects. Sometimes the team has to remove small details because Square fears bad reception (in EP1, they removed the word « abortion » in Dana’s arc but kept details that fly around it so that, even if it’s not told, many people will understand what’s discussed here). A lot of talks and discussions so, but in the end it allows the game directors to defend their vision and make them sure the issues they want to bring / talk about are important for the game. Plus the story being already widely written, any big change would disorganized the story as a whole.


***

**Pop culture references and settings**

Alexis Blanchet then talks about a game for people in their thirties especially with the notion of the rewind that works as a video recorder. For some players (especially those born on the 2000’s), the rewind itself doesn’t mean a lot since they are not used to it. For them, they mainly know DVDs and YouTube where you can directly pick the exact moment you want to watch. 

Then, some obvious references you’ll see in the game: The Goonies (one of the writer’s favorite movie) in which you can feel the inspirations for the mood of Arcadia Bay. They confirm that the city is designed based of Astoria, Tillamook and Garibaldi.

Then, the discussion drifts on the link between try / test / assume and the high school setting. Nothing really interesting / untold here. They admit the story would have work in any school in the world but putting it in the USA was a warrant for a minimum success in terms of sales (plus the fact that they are fans of American culture). Some references on the high school setting The Faculty, Degrassy Jr High, Dawson Creek, Buffy, …

They also talk about one of the main critic on EP1: Clichés characters. Even if they are developed later on the story, they needed to put architectural characters because in first episode, the player will meet / interact with around 10 NPC he doesn’t know but needs to know for the development of the story. It’s easier to digest when you can put a function on each of them and then twist their role later on the story. It is basically putting the player in a comfort zone at first to allow the dev to bring him where they want (darker subjects).

The discussion finishes on the pop culture references. Raoul tells that he wanted all those easter eggs / references to be done with the approval of the game directors because they don’t want them to be out of place or outdates quickly, just like the art direction. The references must still make sense in several years. 

The discussion ended here and some questions from the public were asked, but no replay on that, sadly.

I've never played these very story driven games before, but after playing Gone Home (wich is very much recommended, play at night and with headphones for the best experience) i discovered Life is Strange, and damn, i feel so connected to the characters, when i was in episode 4 i already knew i would miss the game.

I don't post on this subreddit a lot but I do once in a while. I have been coming here almost everyday for the last year. I have enjoyed everything that everyone has shared on here.

Everytime I come on to this subreddit, it makes me happy because everyone of you enjoyed this beautiful game. Well anyways, a few weeks back the user of /u/x_digger had a giveaway. I was a little late to this but he still accepted my LiS story. Today I finally received his art that he made that he gave away to some people.

We have a talent show this Wednesday and I want to sing Crosses by Jose Gonzalez. Good song, but so far I haven't seen an instrumental version that is not Max's cover. Hey, it's a shot in the dark, but I'll go for it.

Hello fellow redditors, I got the game at steam summer sale and love it!

This spoilers the forth episode and to describe my problem I have to tell some major plot parts.

I played to the point where you alternated the past to let William live and then Chloe asks you to end her life by a morphium overdose. I said no, and then Max tries to get back to the past to let William die. I success in sharpening the picture and it should lead to the next scene but all I get is a black screen. I restarted the game, I restarted the computer, but I didn't try to reinstall the game of fear, that my save will be lost.

Some side note: I play with the steam controller, but for sharpening the picture I change to mouse and keyboard.

Did any of you had a similiar problem? If so, how did you solve the problem? I tried to google the issue but could not find anything related to my situation.

Thanks for reading!

Hi,
As some may have been aware, we were streaming 24 hours for Extra Life yesterday, and it went way better that expected!

We surpassed our goal within one hour of going live, surpassing $1000 in 2 hours, which led to our final count at $3292 for Duke's Children Hospital in North Carolina. 

Thank you to Koethe, Hannah Telle, Dayeanne Hutton, Christian Divine, Amethyst Leon and Taylachan, with Luc Bagadoust who unexpectedly joined us for an hour when he said 5 minutes. 

Special thanks to Alejandro Arque for dropping by in the chat during his busy schedule and supporting the show, and to Toby for tweeting out reminders from the official pages and providing prizes for us to give away once we hit our goals.

Also, a big thanks to Zach and Nate for keeping Joey company whilst Jess and I had to get some rest for a few hours, who helped with the steam give away whilst I was absent.

I have to thank Joey and Jess for helping me carry out this amazing idea to reality, for Jess coming up with ideas for tiers and Joey for playing the game itself because his PC is the only one that can handle it.

Finally, I have to thank all of you who stooped by, donated and just had a fun time with us last night. We really hope we can do this again soon!

Hi, fellow Life is Strange gamers.

So, recently I bought this game on sale at the Xbox Summer Sale. I have always wanted to try it, and for the price I paid I thought "Heck! Lets do it", so I did. I started playing it, and to be honest... At first I was unsure if I wanted to continue or not. The theme was a bit of a shot, because when I watch movies and series I try to avoid these as much as I can, because I tend to get bored... But I continued and, without making this a novel, I LOVED it! Never ever have I been so thrilled by a story so sad, that when I started episode 3 (from taking a break the night before), I simply HAD to finish the game (which resulted in me getting to sleep way too late...)!

As said, to make sure this doesn't get too long and complicated... I love all of the characters, they are unique in their own way and im glad I choose the ending I did (which I will reveal at the bottom), but... What is Chloe's style? I absolutely adore her, besides Max ofcourse. That type of girl, if we are only taking her looks into account, has always been of my interest, not that it *should* be someone looking like that, that I will unwillingly give my love to. I, with me probably sounding like a retard now, thought that maybe her style is punk related? What if we included her personality, how could you then describe her? An example could be "lazy, big mouthed punk girl, with a hidious personality", or something like it. Not that I would write that, as its totally off, but who knows what other people think. What do you think for yourself? If I ever met Chloe as she is in the game, in real life, and we became friends... I would totally do everything to keep it together. Not only based on her looks, but also her personality. Would you?





































[EP5 SPOILERS](#s "I promised I would tell you what I choose, and so here it is... I choose to sacrifice Arcadia Bay. I sat there and stared at the two options for some seconds, and choose to spare Chloe's life. I simply couldn't let her go. I knew it was the destruction of an otherwise wonderful town, despite its presence of the Prescotts, upcoming of Pan Estate and outwright boredom. Yes, I know a lot of people died in the storm (if it goes as when Max is wondering around town), and people would say im sick if they knew my reasons for saving Chloe. One of them, though, is that Chloe had already died too many times from the rewinds, and when I eventually saw what happened had I chosen to sacrifice her, Im glad that I did choose to save her. I couldn't bare the picture of that pretty girl laying there on the floor, in a pool of blood, lifeless. And the fact that Max hadn't seen her in five years, and was overly happy to see and be with her before all this, made me choose what I did. I did see someone write (was it here or somewhere else? I can't remember), that it was Chloe's destiny to die, because now Max had been able to spend time with her, and would know that she would forgive her for being away all those years. I didn't buy that, as I almost felt guilty over saving Chloe, but I then remembered that the game is about YOUR choices, YOUR actions, YOUR responsibilites... What YOU feel is the best thing. And in Max's place, with Chloe by her side, I did what I felt was the right thing. To score this off, I then proceeded to read about someone who wrote "...when Chloe has been killed so many times, over and over, it was probably meant for her to die". They may be right, but I didn't buy that either, because in my own mind, what I suspect is the right thing, she didn't suspect that she was meant to die, herself, otherwise I guess she would have just shot herself? I don't know, and im still pondering if my action was right. I just felt bad for Chloe, my "love" for her character was just too high, and I just could't throw her "out of the window" like that. I'll probably stick with this, im sure as hell ain't doing another playthrough, whole game or episode wise, as I know what will happen anyways. Im just glad Chloe and Max are safe and sound, together - probably in Portland!")

EDIT: I forgot to mention this... English isn't my native language, so there may be some grammar and spelling errors. Please have this in mind, as I sometimes struggle to express myself in english correctly, so I don't mess things up.

When I bought the game, I only bought episode 1 as a test to see if I wanted to buy the rest of the game (Only wasted like, $3) and it ran smoothly. After downloading the extra episodes it seems that the game is missing a whole bunch of files, and after searching online I couldn't find any solutions that helped my problem. Please help?

All those characters CONSTANTLY going, "Gee whiz it would be great if I could go back in time and stop that bad thing in my life from happening. Wouldn't that be nice???? wink wink nudge nudge" It was really the one bit of annoyingly repetitive and silly writing in a game generally filled with fabulous and heartbreakingly good lines.
/////////////////////
It parallels movies like The Goonies and Super 8 more than it does LiS, but it definitely has some similarities and I think that if it came out a few years before LiS, it would have been one of the many, many, many influences of/references in LiS. 
The similarities though are:

- Definitely has the small town vibe with a dose of the supernatural mixed in
- there is a girl character with super powers
- the plot revolves around a missing person
- protagonists are kinda shy and quirky and don't really fit in with the rest of the school
- some of the characters bully the protagonists
- one of the characters is really into photography
- one of the characters is a mom named joyce
- there is another big similarity but its a spolier for both LiS and Stranger Things
- oh, and the soundtrack is great too

Regardless though, I think if you're a fan of LiS, you'll enjoy it. Personally I thought it was incredible

Hey folks!

It's about time I actually posted something for this story. Life has just been a bit hectic and I've struggled with this chapter a lot trying to make it feel right, but here it is, Chapter 12.

It's the evening following the previous chapters events.

My Limited Edition arrived today and I already have the game so the key it came with is going out to someone here. (edit: this is a season pass, so you get all episodes)

Want it? Channel your inner Max. Share one of your favorite photos (one that you took yourself!) here. Doesn't have to be LiS-related. Could be a photo of your dog, some cool place you've been to, etc.

I'll keep this **open until the 19th (GMT+8)** and [randomly pick a winner](https://www.random.org/). So feel free to tag any friends who might be interested in the game.

.

**Edit:**

My bad! Life got strange for a few days. Thanks to everyone for joining!

[Here's the list of entries as randomized.](http://i.imgur.com/DM87DXj.jpg) The winner is /u/noteverrelevant! If they don't want it or don't respond, I'll go down the list until the final winner gets it.
/////////////////////
so uhh, not sure if this is spoiler territory because its just a thing i heard, but if you like warren i guess dont read any further.

Anyway, i have a friend that says theres a point where you can see Warren standing outside Max's window, just creepily looking at it... is that a legit thing?? Couse, thatd make me kinda sad i was nice to him...
/////////////////////
I love it but I can't listen to the damn thing in public because I get all teary-eyed.
/////////////////////
and to most it sounds like a bunch of gibberish 
/////////////////////
... That I had no real control over friendzoning Warren. I *wanted* to choose him and I had options to flirt with him, but when the time came and I was able to "romance" him, it was still in a friendzone-y way that fell completely flat of my expectations for that moment. 

I really think this game wanted you to fall madly in love with Chloe. And don't get me wrong, I liked Chloe a lot - but if there was someone I could choose to friendzone, I'd have picked Chloe. This isn't the first instance in the game where I felt like, as the player, I didn't *really* get to choose my destiny... but it was one that bugged me a lot, because this is an area in most people's lives where they do have some control. And why bother having him as an "option" at all if the choices aren't really going to lead you anywhere (except out of pity)? It doesn't really make a lot of sense. 

Besides that, it bothers me how little Warren is appreciated in the game when he saves these girls so often - no questions asked, and often with a smile or a joke to lighten the mood. Why no love for Warren, developers? 
/////////////////////
So, since I began working on my own fan-art folder, I thought maybe someone's interested in contributing to it.

If that is the case, here is the final folder: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8BWX7MPcF2USGJwTkZyTEpPbW8&amp;usp=sharing

Everything is tagged and sorted into sub-folders.

I will then move them to the main folder, sort them and tag them :)
/////////////////////
Hey everyone, I just finished the game a few days ago and have been thinking about everything that has happened. Specifically, in the alternate reality that we enter after saving William. I'm sure everyone else was surprised when Max was a part of the Vortex Club but one of her text conversations has been bugging me. The messages with Nathan:

&gt; Nathan: Yo yo Max
&gt; U around
&gt; 10/02 10:48am
&gt; 
&gt; Max: In the dark room.
&gt; Developing shots for the contest. 
&gt; 10/02 10:51am
&gt; 
&gt; Nathan: Sweeeeet
&gt; So no Two Whales Diner for U
&gt; 10/02 10:51am
&gt; 
&gt; Max: Not yet. I'll see you guys later tho.
&gt; 10/02 10:51am
&gt; 
&gt; Nathan: Peace out
&gt; 10/02 10:52am


Max was in the dark room developing shots?????? I think this has two scenarios. Either Max is taking part in Nathan's and Mr. Jefferson's Dark Room activities or in this reality Nathan is "normal". As in, the Dark Room actually is just a place that she could develop her photos now that they are friends (I guess she went to  a digital camera in this reality?). Either way, I'd like to hear your thoughts as I can't really seem to grasp on an explanation.
/////////////////////
When I started this game I thought the tornado symbolised the Vortex Club.  As the game goes on you see Nathan drugging girls and everyone turns a blind eye because of his family's influence.

Further investigation shows Nathan started the Vortex Club.  His family's donations to the school keeps the principal covering for him.

Later you find out Jefferson was using Nathan and the club for his own needs.  Rachal, Kate, and Victoria had all partied with the Vortex Club.

Seems I was the only one who was a little surprised the tornado turned out to  be real.
/////////////////////
Hi all fans of LIS , I made yesterday a little map of the theater drive in
I'm starting to go more fast for made maps haha :D,and  this one just took me about 3 hours 

I hope you will enjoy , thanks for your comments :D

/////////////////////
So I was thinking about the tornado, Max's  powers, etc and I just came up with a satisfying conceivable theory. 

The tornado has nothing to do with Max or Chloe or the rewind power. It was summoned by the spirits/nature/native americans to restore the harmony of the area (get rid of the Prescotts). Arcadia Bay is situated on a native american land and we know that the Prescotts are polluting the area, deforesting to make space for Pan Estates, hurting the town's fish population etc. They are hurting the nature and the tornado is there to enable the nature to restore (this is supported by the does we see in the town in the sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending. 

Max got her powers and the vision likely from Rachel (who maybe had them herself and never told anybody, hence her popularity). She knew about the coming tornado and warned Max via the vision and gave her the rewind power to save Chloe so that they can survive the storm and run away.

This has as far as I know only one hole and that is the fact that in the sacrifice Chloe ending the tornado didn't come. If it is really a fixed event that has nothing to do with Max and Chloe than it should still happen right? But they I realized that in this ending Nathan ends up in jail and even Sean Prescott is being investigated by the police so the Prescott family basically loses all it's power. And that's what the spirits/Native Americans wanted (to get rid of the Prescotts) so there is no need for the tornado. 

Hope this makes sense (sorry for any mistakes, english isn't my first language).

I finished my first play through of LiS at the beginning of the year on the PS4 and not long after I bought it in a sale on the XboxOne. However I have not touched it since.I see some have played it multiple times and was wondering what was the period of time between your play throughs? I personally feel that I have got over my first play through but don't think I'm ready for the rollercoaster again!
/////////////////////
So this game really fucked me up. Someone please tell me that there is a sequel with the same characters!!!!!
/////////////////////
So I just finished my second playthrough of this game. I really recommend playing this game more than once and role playing different versions of Max. 

I know I love this game for a lot of reasons but one of the many things this game left me confused about is that maybe I came into the second playthrough looking to be sad. I understand that in my culture we view sadness as a "negative emotion" so why do I seek it out?

Do you guys feel the same way? Why do you think this is?
/////////////////////
The trend continues.

Voice your opinion!!!!
/////////////////////
Everyone is talking about how since Max saw the tornado before getting powers, the powers aren't related to the tornado, blah blah blah... But listen.

What if the choice was there from the beginning? Max could let Chloe die from the bathroom, or save Chloe and let everyone else die. She just delayed that choice to the lighthouse.

Of course, she couldn't make the desicion from the bathroom. You can't make a desicion without knowing the options. That's why there's rewind powers. So once she figured out the options from the lighthouse, she could just go back to the bathroom and make a desicion. Bae or bay, as I believe the term is.

Looking over this, I don't think I communicated my idea very well. I think you'll still understand though.

EDIT: Even though no one is going to come back and read this... Anyways, I read a comment on this sub somewhere saying that *two* visions were shown at the beginning of the game, back to back. One of the tornado, and one of Chloe dying.

When she first uses her rewind in the bathroom, she suddenly teleports back to the classroom. Her powers can't do that. Everyone else moves, but she doesn't.

This fits into my theory of the choices being shown at the beginning of the game, and the rewind just helping her to understand.
/////////////////////
Hey guys, I finished the game before 10minutes and im really, really sad that Max didnt pay any attention to Warren... everytime i thought "and now she hugs warren". But i got every time disappointed. He was such a nice guy and finally in the Diner i could show him my feels and i kissed him it was nice to tell him, that i love him too, that was the same with The Walking Dead where i wanted that Lee kiss Carley. They was not even in the cinema... Yeah thats the only thing beside the bullshit ending that piss me off, im sorry for my bad english.
/////////////////////
In replying to a different post this question popped into my skull. It was a topic on what a sequel might be\could be about and we all love to speculate. But it got me thinking.

If we think about what makes Life Is Strange what it is, can Dontnod come out with a successor and call it an LIS sequel?

There's really 2 options here the way I see it.

**OPTION #1**

Dontnod comes out with a successor, sequel, whatever and calls it "LIS 2", "Season 2", etc. I would expect it should follow, somehow, in the footsteps of LIS. A few examples(there are tons certainly.)

* Another all new coming of age story (Maybe, but this may get old quick.)

* Max &amp; Chloe in a new story\setting PLEASEGODSMAKETHISATHINGPLEASE... prolly not tho :(

* A new story with someone else with a rewind or other quirky ability (Kinda hope not. The power is cool but IMO would just feel like a rehash and cheapen the game-mechanic from LIS.)

**OPTION #2**

Dontnod creates a whole new story\characters\setting\mechanic(maybe). But if this is the case, I wouldn't call it LIS-anything. It would feel like an entirely separate story with no link to LIS. It would be like taking something like Gone Home and calling it LIS 2.

I mean, when we think about other stories\games, say like Batman. When Batman 2, 3, etc comes out we kinda expect it will deal with.... Batman! :o

So if there really is no link to LIS then it shouldn't be a "2" at all. They could name it anything, like "Death Is Mundane" or "The Log Lady Memoirs ".

So considering all this, if Dontnod doesn't use the same coming of age vibe or Max &amp; Chloe 2.0 I feel like Dontnod really can't or shouldn't try to make a sequel in the traditional sense. 

What do you guys think?
/////////////////////
Hi all,

So that's might be a daft reason to do a post but, on the other hand, I see a lot of new cases of PLISD (Post-Life-Is-Strange-Depression) after steam's summer sales and I know post-PLISD stories are sometimes nice to have when you are on that first week of post game aftermath. Moreover, sharing our LiS experience is what this community is built upon after all ... 

So here I am, after 6 months of PLISD, I finished episode 5 for the first time exactly half a year ago today ... It got better with time, though sometime I had "relapses". However I learned to enjoy these moments of nostalgia ... Like many of you I went in completely blind, even picked the game kind of randomly: "Looks like a telltale game" I thought ... What a fool I was. Yet, how I could have guessed that for the next 6 months not a day would pass without having a thought about Chloe and Max... 

Never had the courage to go for another playthough myself, but I watched many let's play (birdyboots' one is probably my favorite so far); and brought the game many times, started to hoard fanarts and read fanfictions... many things that I never would have thought I'd do. 

Hell, I used to be skeptical when someone was saying that this game changed their life ... Now I can say it myself, for sure this game changed myself or I wouldn't be writing this post today. It's not an experience you can wash away like that, at least not me.

Well, to be honest, I don't really know where I want to go with this post ... I just had the urge to share a part of my (P)LiS(D) experience with some peoples that went through it too. No matter how silly and uninteresting that post may sound. Thanks DONTNOD for that ! You made me lost countless hours of my life, just thinking about that game, or wondering about if I would ever be able to re-experience something as strong as playing this game for the first time. 

And thanks to all of you. Because I truly believe that part of why this game means so much for me is because of the fandom around it. I mean, wherever you look, the community of this game is just awesome. As I said in a previous comment, I will always fondly remember when I discovered the Blackwell's podcast with their Hannah's interview ... That's when I realized this game was more than just a piece a digital entertainment, it was a shared experience that brings amazing peoples together (in pain, tears and at a priceless cost though). You guys are all amazing, and my only regret is that my artistic talent are limited (inexistant is a more accurate word) thus I can't contribute as much as I want to this community.

TL;DR 6 months of PLISD today, still emotionally comprised sometimes (like today), rant about amazing community, game, PLISD, and how this game left a permanent mark on me.
/////////////////////
From an article back in April: "Although Dontnod has only one game it's speaking publicly about at the moment — Vampyr — each of the developers interviewed for this story did mention another unannounced project that's currently in progress. Asked directly about a Life is Strange sequel, Oskar Guilbert says the studio is "fully focused" on Vampyr, but that the core team from Life is Strange is "doing something I'm not allowed to talk about."

"In a few months, we will maybe reveal more or have a different conversation, but now my focus is Vampyr."

The game they're going to present at Gamescom is listed in the categories of action-adventure and "jump and run": http://www.gamescom-cologne.com/gamescom/exhibitor-search/index.php?fw_goto=aussteller/details&amp;&amp;kid=0013545879&amp;values=%7B%22start%22%3A140%7D

So I guess we can rule out that they're working on a LiS sequel.
/////////////////////
This sub already has a lot of posts covering the connections and nods to the book, but  I didn't see any mention of what I see as the most apparent parallel. 

That is the narrative style of the game, the colloquial language and access to Max's thoughts that make up its subjective view. I think a book called The Art of Fiction describes how the beauty of The Catcher in The Rye is how Salinger has to say all of his many messages and observations of the world through the twisted eyes and limited vocabulary of Holden Caulfield. Considering the diverse range of social issues the game covers, and how it does so most prominently through Max's monologues, I think that's exactly what the writers aimed to achieve through Max **Caulfield**, and did so brilliantly.

"So what's the point of this power, what's the lesson?"
/////////////////////
I recently discovered Dreamfall Chapters. It has a different premise than LiS but I'm 32 minutes in and my awe is the same from what I got from LiS. I know nothing of this series but I am quickly getting very attached to it. 

P.S. If you do play the game w/o playing the prequels make sure you watch the story recap. 
/////////////////////
Saw it in the honest game trailer of Life is Strange
/////////////////////
Trying to work on several things at once is hard business. Often times you find yourself not getting anything done.

*sigh*

Talk about what you liked or disliked about Max. Not gonna lie...I'm probably gonna do this type of topic for each character. Would appreciate responses for this and those that follow. 

Thanks!
/////////////////////
The talk on the cliff was a waste of time, in my eyes. What exactly caused this storm? Saving Chloe or going back in time? If it was going back in time, then using the photo should make things worse. If it was saving Chloe, then why not foreshadow that better and have her get killed by outside forces, rather than her own recklessness? And why does the universe care about the life of one girl? Why does the town compensate for it? There is no explanation why the tornado is there, so why the whole sacrifice conversation? You could just say Max was feeling guilty due to what Warren said, but that means that Max was considering killing Chloe over an assumption and was torturing herself for no reason.
With all that considered, i saved Chloe, because the whole situation made no sense at all. But then, Max and Chloe just STOOD THERE. Like, okay, you decided not to kill your most beloved person, great. But you do care somewhat about those people, right? Why not go back down there and try to help people escape to the lighthouse, no time magic required? And if you're that worried about Chloe, why not have her stay put? She stated several times that she didn't care about her own well being as long as Chloe was safe. Well, she's safe. Helping the other people shouldn't be much of a problem, she walked through it just fine before. Unless she just didn't care about AB at all, and in that case then 1, why give us the option if Max didn't even care about one of them, and 2, that's not the kind of character i wanted to play as.



All that said, it is a really great game, but I'll stick with my own version of episode 5.
/////////////////////
Hello all,

Everyone has theories about what causes the storm. Chloe’s destiny is to die, Native American curse, Max messing with time, the Prescotts did it because they’re d****.

But oh no, for here we reveal the true cause of the tornado and ultimately the true villain of LiS.

Ready?

Are you sure?

http://imgur.com/a/feDRC

Duh duh duh….

The blue butterfly. Yes, the blue butterfly is the one who causes all problems and events in LiS. Why? Because when Chloe is shot, the blue butterfly flies away. No storm comes. No problems. And when you use the fire alarm and Chloe escapes Nathan? The butterfly just sits on the sink. It doesn't move. And the world goes insane.

Chaos Theory my friends. In other words, the butterfly not flapping his wings and flying away is what causes the storm.

So next time you play LiS, look long and hard at this cute little blue butterfly. Because this cute little f***** is the reason events go down hard and we're all getting the feels. All because it couldn’t move its a** when a fire alarm goes off.

And what does it do at the end, after all the problems it causes?

http://imgur.com/a/agk2b

That’s right, it goes and sits on Chloe’s coffin. That evil, evil blue butterfly!

P.S. I didn’t think about the Chaos theory and a butterfly flapping its wings. emilianog94 mentions it in a post I’ll link below. And someone else in another post mentions about the butterfly flying away or not flying away because of the shot/fire alarm (but I can’t remember where).

Anyway, they made me think of this post which I thought I’d throw out for fun/fluff just to make everyone dislike that little cute blue butterfly, which is either the murderer of Chloe or Arcadia Bay :)

/////////////////////
So i finished the game and after long thought i ultimately decided to sacrifice the town. I tried to place myself in Max's shoes and realized I could never sacrifice someone i love like that. (And also to spite that BS tornado). But i cried when I saw AB and i knew all those lives would be  destroyed and i really felt for those people. But then i go on forums discussing the choice and most people really  didn't seem to care about the town at all. Some were even happy that it got destroyed as long as they could keep Chloe. They just discarded everyone like they were nothing. I also did not like Max and Chloe's reaction to the aftermath.


I don't understand why some people acted callous towards AB? The point of the choice was that it was supposed to be hard but most people had no problem and that makes me really sad. Is that how it would be in real life? I just don't understand.
/////////////////////
I got my friend in Korea to buy the game, but she was lost at the end of episode 2.  The English was too hard for her.  I saw a video on YouTube of someone playing with Korean subtitles on PC.  Would anyone know how I can get it?  It would be nice if Dontnod could add new languages but doubt they would late in this game.
/////////////////////
Ok guys, I completed the game 8 days ago and have already watched a complete playthrough (Cryaotic) and am listening to the soundtrack waaayy too much.   

So that's that, what I'm looking for is your personal favourite youtube playthrough and why, because basically.. I need more.  I will play the game myself again in a few months but for now, I need something to fill that giant empty void in my heart.  

So reddit, show me watcha got.

TIL - by doing Max's homework nonetheless - that daguerreotypes are almost holographic. Have a read, it's really fascinating:

&gt; It is hard to compare the daguerreotype, on the other hand, to any other medium, including any photographic medium. It was complained that the reflection interfered with viewing the image. But if the plate is held correctly, the reflection reverses itself in a peculiar way, dragging the viewer into an unequaled illusion of the picture space. The daguerreotype’s detailed
mirage is unlike any other picture. It gives the effect not of a representation of the subject, but of the subject itself - Nature per se staring out at the observer. The impression is not of a picture sitting on the surface of a canvas, or piece of paper, or even on a piece of metal, but of a true spatial existence, distilled for repeated experiences by the viewer.

I'm making an rpg, not very similar to LiS, but I like the feel that the music brings into the gameplay and I was looking to add something similar to it and are always posting original material, was curious as if anyone was interested in working out a deal. 

Doesn't need to be carbon copy LiS sound, or even incredibly similar sounding. Hit up the inbox if you're interested.
/////////////////////
I have immersed myself in the analysis and wallowing of post-LiS the past two days since finishing it. I've heard/read anger, confusion and sad approval at the ending, and I've caught wind of the theories about cut content (incl. some dropped Nathan speech). 

Whatever the ending was "supposed" to be, I feel that a lesson is slowly dawning on me, whether intended by Dontnod or not. I guess it's an interpretation, then. The message or goal of the game is to empower US, the players. 

It feels very much like the bay &gt; bae outcome is the one closer to the heart of the developers - i.e., "canon". Taking that as read then, ultimately Max's efforts were futile. Her ability was a manifestation of the intrinsic human yearning to correct your mistakes (not just big ones, but 'oh I wish I'd thought to yell that as I walked past'). But life isn't like that. The game is Max pursuing an illusion. Chloe, tragically, was supposed to die that day. 

But Max's powers weren't for nothing, as Chloe says in the final scene. Nothing can take away their memories together. After all, Max went through the journey WE just went on, and we have been profoundly affected by that journey - some people even saying they view life differently now. So I take Max's power as being a metaphor for becoming an adult, or becoming a more confident person (it is a 'coming of age' game, after all). 

At the start, she is this insecure, reflective person (the selfies symbolise this), scared to even go and see her best friend. By the end she has learnt that, *by getting involved in life* - talking to the people around her, doing good deeds - she can empathise and effect positive change. It's not her power that does this; it's HER. The power just allows her to realise this. The party scene is kinda the climax/outcome of how she has got involved with all these people, most of whom she had no relationship with at the start.

And of course, Chloe is the biggest influence, imbuing Max with more courage, daring and fire. In return, Max gives Chloe some of her selflessness and humility - shown by her willingness to be sacrificed. 

Life IS strange, and our time over too quickly. The message I take from this game is to *get involved in life*. Talk to people and hold dear all those who are dear to you. 

(A real-life example from my day: there was a tap leaking in our office bathroom. On another day I may not have done anything, thinking that someone else will have reported it, but today - almost visualising the dialogue tree on-screen - I opted to go to reception to report it. I share a joke with the receptionist as a result. Maybe something will come of this? Or maybe not.)
/////////////////////
So Everyone loved life is strange, but whats next, what story could dontnod do next. The way I see it there are several ways the story could continue. Allow me to list them.

**The Sequels**

*Chloe Lives*-Chloe and max have to deal with the death of Arcadia bay, id recommend this be a book and not a game, as there isn't much to do and the book could be more detailed.

*Chloe Dies*-Same as about except its max dealing with the loss of Chloe.

*Max almost dies*- I believe that if they wanted to continue the story, they would need to give you a third ending where you can step out from around the corner, confront Nathan and get shot in Chloe's place. Id say the story would pick up a couple of months after your out of the hospital and catch you up via flashbacks, and the journal for extra details.

*Max Dies*-In this sequel you play as Chloe who now has max's powers and must discover what she did and save the town from the evils of mark Jefferson.

**The Successor**
*New Character same premise*- in this story we get another shy nerdy high school kid who suddenly has supernatural abilities and uses them both to help them gain self confidence as well as save people, I wouldn't do time travel again, maybe mind reading.

**The Prequel**
*Rachel Amber*- The story of Rachel Amber who maybe also had powers like max or maybe didn't, this category could have dozens of subcategories for all the ways you could do it.

So what do you all think the next game from dontnod could be.
/////////////////////
Honestly, one would say how can anyone be bad with such a love for beans. Though, taking everything into consideration. Do you think Frank was a good or bad guy.
/////////////////////
Hey, I'm new. So I don't know whether there is this idea already.

But what about Max rewind to the Bathroom and instead letting Chloe die, step out the Corner and suprise Nathan. After all Max should be able to stop him from Shooting and together with Chloe they should manage to stop him and shouting for help or whatever.  
/////////////////////
I finished Life is Strange about a week ago, and it was the best story i've ever been a part of. I loved Chloe and Max, but especially. The game left me broken inside, i choose to save Chloe and that lead to me finding some fan fiction, about the continuation. I found a truly amazing story called "Two-Girls" and that left me somewhat fulfilled, but i still want more. I won't say im obsessed with Chloe, but is hella close, i'm just weird like that. But i truly love, the idea about Max and Chloe being lovers, i really adore them. What do i do now? I feel like an addict whom can't get his drug. I feels sad and empty inside, even though the fan fiction gave me some fulfillment. I really need some guidance right now. Tl;DR I'm sad as hell, but check out the entire post if you want/have the time. Link to the story i read: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11703575/1/Two-Girls

Edit: Thanks for all the support, keep it comming. It keeps my mind a bit busy, i truly appreciate it!
Edit 2: Is there any chance i could get an actual depression because of this game? When im awake it "Hurts" so bad inside...?
/////////////////////
In the game, I saved Kate. Somebody knows what happens in the episode 4 if you dont save her when u visit her at the hospital? o.o
/////////////////////
Here's something that might come as a surprise to many: I haven't replayed the game. The last time I played the game was finishing Episode 5 for the first time on 10/20/15. When I finished it, I was left with this feeling of serenity, and I felt that that would be shattered if I played the game again. Of course, that's silly, but that stuck with me for months. 
Pretend I put a closing statement here.
/////////////////////
So, i have a serious case of cognitive dissonance around this ending, an i need to talk to someone about it. An it cant be my partner, because i want her to play LiS, and it cant be the other people i talk to about this stuff because they arent great at having 2 conflicting opinions about a thing.
So, heres my issue, im gonna natter about it for a bit n then go away. See, that final episode is just so much less than any of the 4 that come before it. An yet, because it is THE end that were gonna get, i have to take all of its outcomes as is... an the outcomes suggest that i as a person am more than willing to burn everything down in resistance to a universe as a bully. Legit, the ending of LiS places the universe as a whole as an antagonistic dick. Literally its the sort of ass that hands a person something, an then when it wants it back it doesnt just take it, it has to shove push and then threaten you to give it back. An see, i know that thats just bad writing. everything about the final episode stands contrary to the others, from the lack of payoff on the prescott foreshadowing to the 1080 degree spin on jeffersons personality into what amounts to a cartoon character villain.
The thing is though, that i have little doubt the writers intended at some point to pit the player against the town an chloe as a choice... i just had hoped thered be more nuance to it. As it stands, its just tremendously shonky piss poor design.
An then theres the ending itself. If you cant guess by now, i picked chloe. An ya know what, i get that the other choice is "the greater good" but im not actually convinced that is. That choice deletes all of a weeks worth of choices and developmental growth. Its rare for people to have as many 'moments' in a year as Max an co have in a week. To delete that is brutal. Then theres the fact that truth be told im not convinced many of that township would actually want you to kill chloe for them. An then theres the inconsitency that comes from "time travel caused this, timetravel fixes it". I know others argue its a closed loop, but its still shaky as on the logic front. An then, theres the fallout. Ya see, its pretty clear from the epilogue that max will eventually remember her crazy timey week.. to me thats the WORST outcome. Yeah, she grows as a person, but she also gets to slowly go mad as people talk to her about conversations she never had an she eventually decides she made it all up as a coping mechanism.. an thats not even counting what happens to almost everyone else as some of them die, others become the worst, an the whole damn town just continues to die slowly an surely like it was already doing.. thats blatantly horrifying to me.. an i dont feel like a few lives in the long run is as destructive as that either...
AN THEN, because the save Bae ending is so damn ambiguous, theres the very real possibility that many of the township survive. For instance, the final choice is not "sac chloe" an "sac the township of arcadia".. its "sac chloe" or "sac arcadia bay". which to me suggests sac the place. destroy the dying town, the people are a sideeffect. Clearly some of them die, but the hurricane, considering time travel caused it, seems entirely unconcerned with killing you or chloe or infact anyone in general. It just seems to be property destruction focussed. An all of this shit swirls about in my head undermining any actual lesson i might have learned from saving chloe. I mean, the only solace ive got in all of this uncertainty is this.
Chloe, the possibly most unfortunate person ive ever met, doesnt die cold an alone on a bathroom floor with her possible rapist. To me, that seems like the greater good in a nutshell. Anything else is too big to be concerned with when you are one member of a 7 billion strong species.
p.s the whole "chloe was being stalked by death final destination style" nonsense i see bandied about. its nonsense. Chloe is actually depressed, but so against any kind of suicide that she literally cannot bear the idea of it.. but when max is around, she knows that max will rewind. so she takes more risks an doesnt give a shit about the consequences. Shes a timebomb. thats why she doesnt go an promptly die whenever max is out of eyesight. Because yaknow, max is out of chloes eyesight ALOT in that week...
/////////////////////
Hi, im currently playing the last chapter of the game in my PS4 and when I get into the restaurant and I talk to Warren, Max doesn't move her lips when she is supposed to say some sentences. Is this a bug? How can I solve it? Thanks!!
/////////////////////
They played a clip of this song repeatedly during Wimbledon, and every time it made me think of Max and Chloe. The storm, Max and her power, Max's love for Chloe . . . 

It's actually 3 songs presented as one song cycle on the album A Hundred Millions Suns. The mood of the first song and the lyrics just gives me Life is Strange feels like crazy. Especially Pricefield feels. (Perhaps it would be more perfectly appropriate if the story happened in an English seaside town, rather than an American one, but still . . . ) Check the song(s) out to see what I mean. 

Here are the lyrics:
"The Lightning Strike"
[I - What If This Storm Ends?]

What if this storm ends?
And I don't see you
As you are now
Ever again

The perfect halo
Of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against
The planet's last dance

Just for a minute
The silver forked sky
Lit you up like a star
That I will follow

Now it's found us
Like I have found you
I don't want to run
Just overwhelm me

What if this storm ends?
And leaves us nothing
Except a memory
A distant echo

I want pinned down
I want unsettled
Rattle cage after cage
Until my blood boils

I want to see you
As you are now
Every single day
That I am living

Painted in flames
All peeling thunder
Be the lightning in me
That strikes relentless


/////////////////////
I'm working on a scene right now and I've been trying to get a good feel for where the lighthouse is in relation to the beach. I've looked over a few pics and maps but haven't had much luck with anything other than what is already in LIS since it's a fictional location.

In LIS a I got the feeling that people parked down at the north end of the beach and walked up a trail to the lighthouse from the beach.

But looking at the various shots of AB the lighthouse is clearly high up on a cliff. That cliff face runs well past the beach inland, so it looks like in order to get to the lighthouse the trail would be back through the forest. I guess parking is somewhere back there?

Anyone have any ideas on this?

I dunno, it's prolly a little detail, it's just been bugging me trying to get the geo continuity straight in my head.

Could be too that my brain is fried from being stuck on this and I should crash &gt;.&lt;
/////////////////////
My main gripe right now is that there was no option to let Chloe's dad die. As much as I despise the actions David took in the original timeline, and as much as I was invested in Chloe's character, I wanted to stick it out and see where the game would go, plus I knew that changing timelines would mess up Max's head/powers. But of course, the game decided instead to force me into hiding the keys. I know it's dumb to say it's a lazy choice when I know the developers only have so much time/resources/ways of developing a story, but I feel like I was forced into doing something I didn't want to do in the first place out of convenience, which is something I really dislike seeing in an adventure game unless it makes sense. This just felt a bit cheap to me, and the consequences of changing timelines ended up being really unfavorable and just there for "shock value", especially considering how they build up this image of Chloe being happy again only to end up in a wheelchair. I'm going to keep playing the game, of course, but I'm probably going to be rolling my eyes when I hear about 'this' or 'that' changing because of the timeline switch. I hope we get an option to revert back and play out the original timeline. I just really wanna know what's up with that tornado, ya feel me?
/////////////////////
I was at work today as a summer school tutor. The kids starting calling me mister and I thought nothing of it. Then it hit me. They called me Mr. Jefferson. The memories started to flood back. Why??? ;-;
/////////////////////
There have been many people who chose the "save the bay" ending and commented that they feel this is the right choice, and the other choice is wrong. They say that the former is the "good" ending and the latter is the "bad" ending.

If you chose to save Chloe, do you agree with this? Do you think it was wrong, even though you chose it? Or do you think it was justifiable? If you think that you were justified, then why?

Personally I chose to save Chloe, even though I felt that the other option was probably the more moral thing to do. However, I do feel that there are possible justifications for going the other way. But what do you think?
/////////////////////
I can't believe I give my fist post of reddict to LiS.

It've been two days after I walkthrough the stroy and immediately became one of the members of "Post Life is Strange Depression Club". I've browsed the posts here, reading others emotional thoughs about the game and I decided to share mine to you guys.

I never thought I will dive that deep into the game since I am an adult who live in a large city since I was born in Asia.  Nothing simular to the background or setting in the game (life and  environment). But I was wrong. I have to give a great credit to the developor which bring me to a completely differnt virtual world which feel so real. The characters, interaction, the story... This game absolutely on my  "Must play game" list, may be the best in the list. 

I am Max while I was playing the game, I means I was inside the story. I can feel the emotion of her, happyness and sadness, struggling between decisions, and of course the love to Chloe. I felt guilty for leaving her without any words, and upset when knowing what she have faced in that 5 years. It is hardly imagine how an adorable girl come up with these things, and I was part of the reason. Thanks God, at least she is health and alive. I can do anything for her in order to protect her from being harmed again. (At the begining of the story)

At the end of the story, I choosed to sacrifice the Arcadia Bay to save my adorable Chloe, but at the same time feel bad that Chloe lost her family. Actually it is so hard to choose between watching her being killed or let her family die and make her upset. It either be a dead or upset Chloe. However, no matter how many time I can choose, Chloe come first. Is that what Max(me?) think too? I hope so. At least I keep her beside me, and she is alive. 

Of cource I was curious what will be in the other ending. It is totally a disater for me. I never cry because of movie or story but i did this time, did it quite badly to be honest. (Another credit to the game soundtrack, awesome) It feel like I really lost my girl, and it is heartbreaking. Afterward I feel a bit wired (and uncomfort) to realized that may be I have fell in love to her, or just because I was acting Max who really is the one in love with her. I got a bit messy up between reality and the story.

These feeling is so real for me, no matter in game or not. After I have finish the game, I feel jealous to the grils friendship (Or love, which I more prefer it is), which I never get from bros. At the same time I am even jealous that Max can have Chloe, who I think is a very cool and charming person to be partner with. 

In short, my head is filled with Chloe and the her sceens since I finished the game, all the time. It is a quite special gaming experience which I never have. I found that I have built up a very deep relationship with the characters, specially with Chloe. Unforgetable but sad.

The only problem now is what should I do next to walk out of the PLiSD. I am planing to play "Love is Strage" and read some fans fiction and hope to know anything great happen between Max and Chloe afterward. Any positive and sweet fiction recommand? 

Btw, English isn't my first language so feels free to correct me.
/////////////////////
As we know, Rachel Amber was everyone's friend and was exceptional at pretty much everything she did. She skated with the skaters, partied with Vortex, befriended the administration, etc. Max eventually accomplishes the same, and almost everyone mentions how similar Max and Rachel are.

I think Rachel could also rewind time.

She was killed by Nathan from an 'overdose'. As we know, Jefferson's serum rendered Max's abilities as useless. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that Rachel was caught off-guard when she was injected and was then unable to rewind time and save herself. But, this doesn't matter anyway - read onto find out why.

The major key in my theory is the doe and Max's initial vision of the tornado. We have no idea how or why Max has her powers, so there are a few ways this theory could work. The one I find to be the most reasonable is that there is always one 'Rewinder', and when he or she dies, the power is passed on to another.

Rachel had very likely manipulated time to see every possible outcome for Arcadia Bay. There would be a reality where Rachel saved Chloe, yet still destroyed Arcadia Bay because she is destined to die. There would be another reality where Rachel, Chloe, and Max were all friends. The key here is how the powers were transferred, how the doe plays in, and *how Max knew the lighthouse would be safe* from the tornado.

Here is my explanation: when Max has a vision, she passes out in real life and is warped to a seemingly random moment involving the tornado. When Max comes back from the vision, she is shown waking up. When the game starts, *Max is waking up on the ground near the tornado* as if she was waking from a vision, hinting that this is not a vision but actually another reality.

In the tornado vision, which is actually just an alternate reality, Max has had Rachel's powers and used them to save Chloe, just like we did in the game. In the tornado vision reality, however, Max had been great friends with Rachel, and before Rachel died, she told Max everything (similar to how Max tells Chloe in Episode 5) and somehow, Rachel knew the lighthouse would be untouched by the tornado, which is how Max knew it would be safe.

Now, the doe. Rachel had acquired a photo from Max, probably from before the two of them met since Max has no memory of ever knowing Rachel. She gave it to Max and had her jump through that photo and into the normal timeline with her new powers. The Max we play as is this Max. As Max states in the last episode, she won't remember anything after she leaves the bounds of the photo, so she would have no recollection of what happened. And since the doe appears to be both Rachel's and Max's spirit animals, the doe represents the bond between the two girls and only appears when one of Rachel's timelines coincides with Max's current timeline(this is even cooler if you consider Max's doe pendant at Chloe's funeral, it's like she's paying respect to Rachel as well).

There you have it. Way overthought, probably not even remotely accurate, but hopefully it will provide a new angle when viewing the game. Rachel's motivation for passing the power onto Max is uncertain considering she could have chosen between many timelines herself, but it's possible she thought the tornado occurred if she saved HERSELF, not realizing that Chloe was the true catalyst, thus sacrificing herself in the end by sending Max into a timeline where she had died so Chloe AND Arcadia Bay could survive.

Thanks for reading!
/////////////////////
Same heavy day just have been passed again. Full of the awful happened was in here same place with mine. I am in café now where is my almost favorite place but I can’t say I love this café, because I don’t really favor this one if I can go everywhere that I most would love to go. So why I am here cause it is very close to my home and subway station that I can get the station directly from my work place. And it’s very cheap comparable to other café nearby.
Few weeks ago, I bought some books relating to study business in stuff by myself, and was thinking it will be really great for me to do so. But unfortunately I cannot concentrate to not only study but also anything I need to do. The problem is actually everything but the most of thing is I can’t find the reason why it happened to me at least two times a year since I was in high school student, and now I really need to figure this one out for to be a mature person.
When some dusty starts disturbing me to do the right decision, I always conflict to that situation it leads me to some peril chaos then I get dark and blue energy that is guiding me dept into the ocean.  

/////////////////////
No topic on the weekends...that might or might not become a thing. May just supplement it with more LIS fan creations that I find.

As we all know in Life Is Strange that are several moments where Max will think back on past events. Some of them involving Chloe and others more doing with recent events. You also have her writing down her thoughts throughout the game as you play. Are there moments where you sit down and just reflect on everything?
/////////////////////
Hi! Not really sure if this is allowed on the sub or not, because I browsed through the subreddits rules and didn't find anything on streaming.

Anyways, ever since I got my new computer, I've been asking friends to suggest me games to play, and one of them suggested that I pick up Life is Strange!  Thankfully, at $10 for all 5 episodes on Steam, I dove right in.

Now I'm just curious if anyone would be interested in joining the experience with me? lol

Feel free to join me on twitch [here](https://www.twitch.tv/jvymvr) and I'll try to interact with everyone through chat!

If this gets enough traction, I'll see if I can make a regular streaming schedule :D
/////////////////////
In the 'sacrifice Chloe' ending, I kept waiting for a scene of Max bawling once her memories came back to her. I expected that to happen at the lighthouse before the funeral but it didn't. I mean, if it were me and I realized that I effectively chose to end my best friend's life, I would break down. Did anyone else wonder about that, too? 

I guess I just wanted to cry with Max... I was certainly already sobbing on my own. :P
/////////////////////
Tornadoes don't form over sea. Either hurricanes or waterspouts do. And the storm was obviously not a hurricane since it wasn't 900km across but a waterspout wouldn't have destroyed the town. They are less powerful than tornadoes. Frank's home, some boats and maybe a couple of unfortunate civilians would probably be toast but certainly not the whole of Arcadia Bay.

I'm definitely being really pedantic here but this bothered me more than it should. I get the dramatic effect and how if the choice at the end choice was [EP5 SPOILERS](#s "Kill Chloe or destroy Frank's trailer and cause some other miscellaneous damage in town") the choice would've been much less difficult, but this still bugged me. Thanks GCSE geography.
/////////////////////
i was just wondering after finishing the game and still wanting more, is there a season 2 planned for lis?????
/////////////////////
The final choice is tougher than it seems at first glance. If you save the town, noone will know you saved them, or how hard you had to fight to save them. 

Other than that I loved the symbolism of the butterfly(Chloe) and the deer(Rachel). 

I also enjoyed the major plot twists when I discovered the dark room, when I saved Chloe into a wheelchair, not to mention the rollercoaster in the last episode when you discover who the real bad guy is. 
/////////////////////
So I just finished the game this afternoon, and I was wondering something. The doe, and probably the butterfly too, is of course Rachel warning/asking for justice, but when Max let Chloe die (yes, I made that horrible choice) for the last time, Jefferson and Nathan were both arrested. Did Rachel warn Max in this timeline or not? Did her soul find peace at last?
/////////////////////
Please, bear with me. Maybe this post might come out as pretentious or absurd but I wanted to talk about my experience with Life is Strange. 

After I had finished the game on Thursday and was extremely emotionally drained with a tightness in my chest I haven't felt in a long time; actually, simply put, that's an understatement. I cried, I cried so damn much I couldn't really see straight anymore. Basically, I spent the next three days in a very deep and dark hole of depression coupled with fears of letting something go that has become so, so important to me.

You see, my emotional state is rather volatile and I get attached too tightly far too easily; though only to fictional characters.

And in truly rare cases - or maybe Life is Strange is actually the first case to get this far - I lose my sense of reality while playing,  meaning I get immersed to the point where, I don't actually experience a videogame or a story but instead, I feel as though I become the character.

I reckon that sounds absolutely ridiculous and maybe it is, but I felt like I did not experience Life is Strange as a gamer but as Max Caulfield.

The same thing is true for the ending. I did not feel like I just made the decision to sacrifice Chloe Price. I felt like I just made the decision to sacrifice MY best friend, the most important person of MY life and the one I love with all MY heart.


Now how did I cope? I didn't, for three days that is. I felt lost, hopeless, devastated and by god, I missed Chloe hella much.

I tried to stalk all possible sources of fanart, past chapter discussions, walkthroughs, reactions of like-minded people to key moments; nothing helped.

The reason for that, I believe, is just how the ending was constructed. Because of the nuances and repercussions the ending brings with it, without any cheerful offset - "Max grew as a character" is just such a weak argument - it felt like a punch in the gut of such proportions that for three days, I did not feel as though I would recover.

What ultimately helped me get out of that dark room I was in was "Love is Strange", a fan project in visual novel form that gave me precisely what I needed: An AU, where everyone was alive and happy.
You cannot imagine the joy I felt when I saw Chloe and Max again, just...talking.
If anyone from the Love is Strange team reads this, thank you, truly.

Anyway, that's enough of that mushy shit. I'm sorry you had to slog through all that.
Thank you though. I really needed to get all that off my chest.
/////////////////////
This is my first post on reddit, so sorry if I don't do this right. I searched and did not find this story posted here.

It is a fanfiction that takes place after the [SPOILERS] sacrifice Arcadia Bay [SPOILERS] ending. I am not the author, just found it.

https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11729462/1/You-Found-Me-Dressed-in-Black

This might be of interest for those who felt the ending was too short and needed more. However, it does go with the idea of Max and Chloe as a couple.
/////////////////////
**What a journey.** 

As many others have commented, I've never felt so emotionally involved in a game before. I came late to this having only recently invested in a PS4. I've since completed MGSV, The Last of Us and LiS. All games resonated, but LiS pulled me in the furthest and hit the hardest. 

I even emailed Dontnod. In 25 years of game playing, I've never felt compelled to directly thank the creators. I'm a sentimental chap, and these 'slice of life' tales get to me easily - but I've never come across one like this in the gaming medium before. It resonates all the more. 

There's a lot of people on here discussing how they cope after finishing it and which ending they picked (I was shocked from the player stats to see that it was so close!). 

As one way of 'coping', I thought it might be nice to discuss *which details from the game brought you the most joy - or sorrow*. I'm sure we've all overlooked some, so it would be nice to share. 

This game provoked skin crawls and even tears in several places - but the part that hit me hardest was when Max entered the Everyday Heroes gallery. I was reading all the texts to find out what the hell had happened, and left Chloe's thread till last (obviously). I can't remember what one of the texts said, but it ended with an emoji. 

We had never seen such levity from Chloe until that point. How tragic that it wasn't to last. 
/////////////////////
SO the end song to video games can be either forgettable, or memorable, a few that come to find form the latter are [M4 part II](https://youtu.be/2MQ_DNklrFo) at the end of mass effect, [Still Alive](https://youtu.be/Y6ljFaKRTrI) for portal, the [Dog Song](https://youtu.be/d1nDafqdH9o) from Silent Hill 2.  These all are incredible moments to the game themselves.  But when i finished Ep. 5, and when [Spanish Sahara](https://youtu.be/6GJO_RpBnEg), i was completely overwhelmed.  After all you go through, all you see and experience, and all you feel, this song is just a sweet little cherry on you dessert of heart-breaking depression.  Anyone else feel the same.  The emotional impact of this song definitely make it one of the best songs in any game.  I know it's not much, but what other songs made you feel similar when you've finally triumphed and sit watching the credits roll (tears are optional.)

EDIT:  Added more songs
/////////////////////
I have access to a 360 at all times, Xbox One that's not the case so I'm curious if it will be a weaker experience on last Gen (no way I'm not looking for port stuff after last Gen shadow of mordor. Fool me once.)

Edit: I bought the game on 360. Pretty cool but I have to get used to them being sock puppets or Canadians or something 
/////////////////////
Hi all,
I posted the link to the first video of Life is Strange in my no commentary, methodical, completionist run two days ago, saying that Episode 2 was coming soon.
Here it is:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF6C2HolDC8 
I'm mainly doing this because there are a lot of videos out there that have commentary in them, which IMO distracts from the beauty of the game itself, hence my best effort to try and present as neat a run as possible.
Anyhow, thanks! Have a hella-good day.
/////////////////////
I finished Ep5 on Friday and after the ending I feel so hollow and sad.
I choose not to sacrifice Chole and I know it was a very selfish choice but I wanted them to be together so much.That night I had a nightmare I was in an empty room and there was Chole cries in the corner, then I realized I was in Rachel's room. I tried to comfort her, but she didn't react to my words.When I looked away from Chole the room was filled with Rachel's missing poster.I was stunned  and Chole was still sobbing. When I blinked my eyes everywhere was dark and I could see the one huge missing poster in front of me and Rachel in the poster looked at me and that's when I woke up.

I don't know it was the dream or the summer heat I was sweaty as hell in the 3 a.m after realizing I can't sleep now I went to my desktop played the last chapter again choose different ending.
and man~ that kiss ,gunshot and crying scence rip my heart to shreds.I know it was the right choice and probably developer's intended ending.

And still I can't get over it **:(**
I don't usually subscribe game subreddit but I had to this time. After subscribing I read really interesting comments, but still I feel so bad. So unfair that Max have to wreck the whole town just to be with Chole.I too don't think that Max's journey was pointless because at least Max spent some time with Chole instead watch her die right away after 5 years not seeing her.

So would it be good idea to play again from the begining?? 
Any suggestions are welcome.
for now I'm just listening to Life is Strange soundtracks

/////////////////////
First of all, I fucking loved the game. It's most definitely one of my favourite games I've ever played (and that's a lot!), really.

However, as a lot of other people do, I think the ending choices were meh. And it was both because of what they were, and how they were done. I went with the sacrifice Chloe ending, and I even ended up sobbing (don't think it has ever happened to me in a videogame), thinking back to it it feels weird that literally every choice I made during the game got erased, and serves no purpose. This is my only problem with it, outside of that, it was very, very well done.

Then I checked out the sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, and I think it makes no sense, it shouldn't even be considered canon. So first of all Chloe is totally okay with sacrificing the entire town to save herself. Not a very important plot hole, but even if I let other person make the choice, I'd be affected. What really bugged me is that as they drive through Arcadia Bay, everything doesn't seem that damaged. Even the Two Whales, which was probably one of the weakest buildings out there, held up pretty good. And Chloe and Max just drive by, zero fucks given. I understand they probably just wanted to get he hell out of Arcadia Bay, but they don't even stop to check if Joyce had survived for fucks sake! (we're taking about Chloe, who still hoped Rachel was alive after being disappeared for 6 months!) And knowing Max, she'd definitely want to at least try to help people who could be alive, namely Joyce and Warren at the Two Whales. I'm assuming this just means that everyone has died and they know it, so we get back to the same place where we were in the other ending: every single choice you've made... Doesn't matter at all. At least some big choices mattered at the end of Mass Effect 3. [/rant]

But I'll say it once again, no matter what, the game was awesome... I just wished they'd done some extended cut to explain this things a bit better, because this game deserves it.

/////////////////////
Hey so I just finished the game like half an hour ago as I type this and just loved it. I'm so excited I wanted to share it with everybody so I've been browsing the tumblr and reddit stuff for it since beating it. Just everything about this game is so wonderful, the soundtrack, the story, the characters. Max was such a great protagonist and it was crazy how similar me and her were, she was basically me if I was a girl and liked photography from the shy demeanor to dislike of drugs. Plus I've always been enamored by the idea of being a girl so that sorta made me identify with her a bit more which was awesome. I loved to walk around and talk to people in the first episode, it was a blast interacting with things and getting Max's input on them, and all of the little hidden things were super cool like the running gag about the guy getting his backpack stolen. I feel like I missed a ton of stuff which is rare in story games where it's easy to be completionist which I can appreciate. After playing through it, I felt my throat catch with the ending and was fighting back tears it was just so touching. I'd have to say episode 4 was my favorite though, all of the detective work was a ton of fun and I could appreciate how the game didn't just hand stuff to you but made it easy enough to still figure out. Well that's it, I'm just so excited from beating it I had to share.
/////////////////////
So I finished this amazing game today and I'm now part of the "I'm an emotional wreck and don't know how to cope with the real world" club. I'm a grown man but had to fight off the tears at several times in the game.

I don't know if many people noticed but by the end of the game you get a link to www.lifeisstrange.com/talk where you find several contacts, in case events in the game have affected you and you wish  to talk to someone. I was just curious to know if anyone has used them? The thought did cross my mind.

The game definitely struck a chord with me, specially the friendship between Chloe and Max which is something I would want nothing more to have in my life. That one childhood friend that is always there for you, who makes everything OK and all the problems in the world seem insignificant. I had no moment of hesitation at the end of the game choosing [EP5 SPOILERS](#s "whether to sacrifice Chloe or Arcadia Bay").
/////////////////////
Does anyone else think that Max really has only two choices in the end of EP5?

Because if you think about it, in the beginning of EP5 Max goes back to Mr. Jeffersons class and sends the text to David to investigate Mr. Jefferson, which leads to his arrest, and Max is in San Fransisco when the tornado strikes. She changes the future. Ok, it didn't work out but she was pretty close.

So if Max can do that, then surely she can do something else with her choices at the end.

Let’s say Max goes with the ‘Save Arcadia Bay’ ending, so rather than just let Chloe die, couldn’t Max save Chloe (she already knows where the hammer to smash the alarm is), and then just send a text or write a note to herself about how everything will play out in the following week. She would then know everything about Mr. Jefferson and Rachel, could tell David about Mr. Jefferson again, could warn as many people who believe her about the tornado striking Arcadia Bay, and know what happens with Kate.

So then Mr. Jefferson and Nathan get arrested, Chloe survives, many people will hopefully survive the tornado (through some sort of preparation or leaving - if you can warn the homeless woman then surely you must be able to warn a few others). Sound good? Hella yeah (just my opinion) :)

Don’t get me wrong I love, love this game, and I get that everyone will have different opinions on the endings and what they think its messages are (such as having to live with the consequences of your choices). But just having two choices at the end seems a bit unfulfilling considering that Max has time travel powers and could at least try a few other options.

I don’t know if this has been discussed before but what do you all think?
/////////////////////
After playing this game I felt like it's the first time I truly connected to characters in a game. I connected with Chloe more than Max in the end. I just couldn't let her go, even though sacrificing a whole town is a horrible thing to do. So I want to know if there are any similar games that will hit as hard, or if this game is a one off masterpiece.

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! Feel free to suggest more, but here's a list of the suggestions so far for anyone else that stumbles upon this thread and had the same question as me:

To The Moon, 
A Bird Story, 
Mass Effect Trilogy, 
Persona (later games), 
Steins;Gate anime series, 
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, 
Final Fantasy X, 
Oxenfree. 
PS3: 
The Last of Us (with DLC), 
Beyond: Two Souls.
/////////////////////
I have just recruited a new member of the feels train, if you will. I have absolutely no idea how he'll react to the big decisions, the side characters, of the overall composition of the game. I want to update this with his reactions for each episode. 
But I'm excited! It's been MONTHS since I finished episode 5 and I still get a little emotional when I see posts about LIS scattered on my front page. It'll be fun to see someone's reaction from a new perspective, almost similar to how our reactions were when we first played the game. 
Okay no need to ramble. Time to make a bacon omelette! 
/////////////////////
I played games like To The Moon that makes me shed a tear or two, but nothing long-lasting. But the scene where Kate was at the rooftop... man I can still feel the depressing void (I just finished it a few minutes ago, but still...). I couldn't save her. I tried to befriend her at the start. I answered her call, I didn't take her picture (my bad), I erased the website on the bathroom mirror, I really liked Kate. She had a smile worth protecting. But fuck, I was stupid and allowed her to jump. I felt and still feel completely useless. I answered 'Everybody will forget!' (about her video) instead of 'Be Strong' and boom the fuck-up begins.

I don't even want to start Episode 3 yet. My emotions can't handle this mess. I will miss Kate. It added insult to injury when I saw that the stats showed that 63% were able to save Kate. Damn it. WHY NOT ME? :(

Apologies for the rant. This is a beautifully written game though so props to Square Enix and all the devs. One of the most invested I've been in a single-player game in a while.
/////////////////////
Title says it all ^-^ I would prefer not having to spend $30... $20 is about... Max.. I'd spend.. Ha! :D
/////////////////////
Wow. Thats up in my top games with TLOU. I thought it would be peachy after Mark Jefferson (no more Mr since Max decided) and end in San Fran. But i kept thinking about that tornado and bam its still there. I stuck it out with my bestfriend and let it all burn. If i could draw i would make some fan art with both of them skipping around with huge smiles but with tears rolling down their cheeks at the same time. Hella awesome game.
/////////////////////
I don't even want to call it game, something like a work of art would fit better. I consider myself a gamer, but in my 15 years of life i never had any experiences as crazy as with Life Is Strange, the game struck home, the sudden change of my life, the effects of simple decisions. I attached myself to the characters as i never did before, I've made decisions without thinking straight, and regretted them shortly after, but even though i could've changed them going back in time i found myself guilty covering my mistakes. I bought this game in the Ultimate Game Sale on Xbox and i could say for sure that it was worth every penny. I felt happy having a nice time with Chloe, i felt crap not picking up Kate's call and causing her suicide, i cried when i saw all the damage I've caused when i walked though hell, and I've felt fear when Jefferson got me. This game played with my feelings in a way i'm sure not much else could do. I just finished the game about 10 minutes ago, and now i'm not even sure what i will do. I usually am a quite not emotional-driven guy, but i let this game take me wherever he wanted, i feel like it took me to the extremes, the happiness and sadness without i even having to move myself out of my chair. I will play this again, i will do everything differently or at least try. Anyways, a huge thanks to all the developers, i can't even wait for the next game (If there's going to be one). If you read it through, thanks. Sorry for not being coherent, but this is just me throwing my thoughts into text, just after the end of a experience i would never like to end. How can i deal with it being over? This left me so empty but at the same time so full... Thanks again for the experience!
/////////////////////
[Here's](https://open.spotify.com/user/rscher91/playlist/2ssobm8PLkQFM1TaS50NJO) the Spotify link. They're all songs that remind me of the original soundtrack. I even tried to order the songs like they'd play in "episodes," with 3-4 songs per episode! I know that other people might not agree that the songs are "Life is Strange"-y, but I figured I'd share regardless. I hope at least some of you like it! :)
/////////////////////
I've been searching the interwebs a lot the past few days. I just finished the best game i've ever played, and i won't go on a long rant about how much i loved Max and especially Chloe. But is Life is Strange 2 confirmed? i've read that is is confirmed, and some other websites says it is all speculation! Maybe some of you Guys can enlighten me! :)
/////////////////////
As many people who are visiting the subreddit right now, i bought this game during the summer sale and i recently finished it. Every time i finished an episode i would go looking for the discussion threads and read about this sub thoughts.

Going from saying that Chloe was an ungrateful bitch and let her die by the train over and over, to falling in love with her even going as far as destroying an entire town.

I read so much praise about the game with every release and liked reading about the other side of the coin in terms of hard choices, but everything changed in the last episode, there were so many comments of disappointment for the ending because it came down to 2 choices; being selfish and destroying the bay to keep your best friend or sacrificing your best friend for the greater good.

IMO leaving the ending to be only with the sacrifice Chloe, go back in time and erase everything i've done, should be the only ending since It’s still heartbreaking for most of us.
The game already gives a great explanation to why, even if i did that, it doesn't take away the memories of that week, in other[ words](https://youtu.be/BvTNyKIGXiI?t=13s).

Imagine making a tasty dip for a party and nobody but you and your drunk friend ate it and enjoyed it, the following day he doesn’t remember but you do, and you remember the memory. I don’t know if this was a good example but it’s the way i see it.

Maybe in Season 2(fingers crossed) Dontnod can set up a story where the conflict is solved in a way that our choices have an effect in the finale. The way i see it, the plot can’t be solved another way without Max asking pretty please the tornado to stop and THAT would’ve been a shitty ending.

/////////////////////
Hi everyone, first time Reddit user here.

So anyway, I just finished Life is Strange the other day (I chose to save Chloe and sacrifice Arcadia Bay) and I literally cannot stop thinking about it. I kid you not, I've never thought about any other game, or anything (film, television, comics, books) as much as Life is Strange. Looking around the internet I've come to the conclusion that there's a few others out there who probably feel the same way.

So I would like to see Max and Chloe's story continued in some way (don't ask me how that would be done for the sacrifice Chloe ending).

Here's what I'm thinking (the second idea is from a fanfic on LiS - I'll post a link to the story below):

After Max chooses to save Chloe and they leave the ruined Arcadia Bay, maybe we could have some sort of interaction with them in their new lives. Maybe they are best friends or maybe they're in a relationship? They could be living in a small home in San Fransisco (or somewhere else), and Max is trying to find work as a photographer while Chloe is working a part time job, and they are struggling to get by but because they are together they are happy. We could play as Max going around and still using her rewind powers to save people and stuff (like she did with Alyssa continuously). Then she could be hanging out with Chloe and stuff, and coming to terms with what happened in Arcadia Bay. Maybe Max is working at a charity that helps people suffering with depression. And maybe, there is another mystery (another murder?) that they have to solve in San Fransisco.

OR

Max and Chloe have left Arcadia Bay after the disaster and are living in San Fransisco, just trying to get by as two teenagers who are homeless and probably have no money after the events of Life is Strange. So after they’ve been in San Francisco, lets say a week, we discover that maybe Mr. Jefferson somehow has set up Chloe for the murder of Nathan and she is now being hunted by the police for it. So Max and Chloe have got to find a way to prove Chloe’s innocence. And you could also deal with how their relationship is going and the way they come to deal with the events of Life is Strange.

I really think that Max and Chloe’s story isn’t finished and that it has only just begun. Chloe having to come to terms with the death of Rachael and her mother. Max having to deal with the fact that she sacrificed everyone in Arcadia Bay for Chloe. And the only way they can deal with that is together.

So that's what I'm thinking the story could continue with.

Anyone else have any ideas/thoughts on this?

Here's the link to the story btw: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12032668/1/Max-and-Chloe-The-Gift

Did anything at all happen in the story between chloe and that prick nathan?
/////////////////////
Jesus christ, I just finished the game ..have never sat though a more heart breaking story.

This wrecked me in ways I cannot imagine, my eyes are so damn blood shot right now, headache light headed.
That damn kiss at the end and listening to the final gunshot. I'm sorry I know this isnt exactly a productive post just I could not imagine how hard this was going to end up hitting me when I played the Ep1 I got as a gift.
/////////////////////
I feel so emotionally drained. This is the first game in a long time that has made me feel so attached to the characters, the setting, and world around it. 



I can't imagine diving back into the game so quickly because of I would have to revisit the junkyard, deal with Mr. Jefferson again, Kate, alternate Chloe, etc *shudders*

How did you deal with this Post-Life is Strange depression?

/////////////////////
We were previously using Naut 3.2, but that was getting quite old. So following in the footsteps of /r/Vampyr, we have now upgraded to Naut 4.0.

There might be some things that look weird, so if you notice any of that, please let us know!

Ps. If you're on mobile you won't notice the CSS upgrade, but we will be beautifying the mobile experience too (if your app supports it)!

EDIT: Some changes have been made:

1. The text in the footer is now white (to make it more readable)
2. The bar at the very top now gets a black translucent background when hovering (also to make it more readable)
3. The sidebar image and the footer image have been switched (this doesn't make anything more readable, but IMO it looks better anyway)
4. Link flairs are now back to the right color!

Thank you for your feedback!
/////////////////////
Most of us have someone close in our lives that we generally would do anything for. Like in Life Is Strange you can hold the responsibility or throw Chloe to the wolves. Would you actually take the blame for something for a friend or a loved one?
/////////////////////
Hi everyone!

First of all, I'm not sure if this is breaking any rules.  If so, please smite me down mods :)

Anyway, after recently picking this game up during the Steam Summer Sale, I've decided to put together a very thorough walkthrough on YouTube showing off as much of the game as I can in a single run.  If anyone is interested, here is the link to Episode 1.  Episode 2 coming soon!

/////////////////////
Long story short, I had a problem with my game crashing while saving in episode 5 (thank u game), so I had to find another save file on the net to replace the corrupted one. The problem is that beyond the choices that are almost the same the person didn't choose to kiss Chloe in the third episode... Most of you probably know we need that for the Max/Chloe kiss ending. I already played the game once some time ago but I had other issues with save files and couldn't get that ending either (looks like the game wants to keep this ending from me lmao) and I'd like not to play it all over again for the 3rd time... So I was wondering if any of you had a save file with this option and simply could give it to me ? (The save files are in the documents.) Also if you have all the pictures it'd be even better ! Thank you very much !
/////////////////////
Do you think Chloe and Max are just best friends or is there something else brewing there? I found it as just friends but what are your thoughts?
/////////////////////
I don't know what to do anymore. 

I finished Episode 5 a few hours ago, and I can't move on. I can't let go of this game. I've fallen in love with this game. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, the connections, all of it. I don't know how to go on with my life as if nothing ever happened. I don't think that I can. It feels like a piece was ripped out of me, and left in Arcadia Bay. I'm sitting here, still just crying uncontrollably, listening to the soundtrack on Spotify, looking at a screenshot of Chloe. She's my favorite character. I think she's my favorite person ever, real or not.

Chloe. 

I think that as ludicrous as it sounds, I've fallen in love with Chloe. Or the idea of Chloe. She's perfect. I want to find my own Chloe for this life, but I know that's not possible. That idealized, perfect, person just doesn't exist. And that fact makes my heart hurt. 

How do I go on with my life? A week ago, I had never before been so invested in a videogame. A work of fiction. And I never thought that a work of fiction could have such an impact on my emotional state. I never thought that this game would have such an impact on my life. I'm in shambles now that it's over.

After seeing the connection that Max and Chloe had, I'm angry that I don't have that same connection with anyone, and I'm sad that I probably never will. I'm surrounded by people in this life, but this game has made me feel all alone. I'm all alone.

What do I do now? Where do I go now...?
/////////////////////
I didn't sacrificed Chloe but we all know wich one is the real ending or let me put it like this the more shiny ending.

I saved Chloe but that ending was just meh sadly :/

And it hurts me so much that Chloe dies unhappy she will die without the memories that she made with Max she will never know Max was back after 5 years she will die because she got drugged.

Why must the good humans always go :(

Ohh and btw 1 thing i didn't get was on the funeral there was Victoria but Max Parants didn't even show up thats just rude.

Such a awesome game the ending hurts still but the pain in my heart will prob. last a while.

And sorry about my english it's not my native language peace.
/////////////////////
I would love to have a gif from the menu of this game, in a way that I can use it as a wallpaper to my android (I'm only saying that is a android because a don't know if there are a difference in android and iPhone wallpapers), but I can't find anywhere in the Internet. 
 The only thing I could find was a video whit 10 minutes of the menu, but o have no ideia in how to make a gif, and in a perfect loop? I just can't. 
 But if anyone have and could share here it would be great!!!
/////////////////////
I must say that was the best 8 dollars I've ever spent. I owe the developers more. I never write things like this but I feel compelled to because of how much this game has impacted me since I finished. Putting me in the shoes of a 18 year old girl coming of age in a pretty fucked up situation and having it done with such perfection is an experience that I will cherish forever. This game is so fucking good. The relationship between Chloe and Max was absolutely amazing and yes I did keep Chloe. How could you not you monster??!!?? Lol 

I feel like I will be forever in debt to the Devs for allowing me to play such a wonderful game. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I can't wait to play the game again to spend more time with Chloe. Should be hella fun. (: 
/////////////////////
Either that or the details are fishy. Who else noticed the three [ichthys symbols](http://guides.gamepressure.com/lifeisstrange/gfx/word/597330589.jpg) on Kate's room wall and the four [fish skeletons](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CDM5ga5WIAAjRyE.png:large) in Chloe and Rachel's shack in the junkyard? It's easy to miss the connection.
/////////////////////
How much did Nathan's father know about what his son and Jefferson were doing? Do you think he was in on it too?
/////////////////////
So I finished this game yesterday and I still can't get it out of my head. None of my friends have played it, but I feel the need to talk about my experience with people who did, so naturally one quick google search landed me here. (I actually created a Reddit account just to post this).

I loved everything about this game. I loved the story, the serenity of the environment, how the music perfectly fits the game and how the social issues were handled.

I loved that you could just sit and hear the thoughts of Max, with these beautiful shots and the calm music. I also liked that the Vortex club party really had a mix of 25 minutes, instead of just one song on repeat. Felt like a real party going on.

I loved the little details that ended up making a big difference in this game. I always like to read every thing that is highlighted and try to not miss any area in a game. This time it was actually rewarded, in the scene with Kate on the roof. I remembered the card Kate's dad sent her, was always nice to Kate and I ended up saving her. I felt really happy and so sad at the same time.

I loved how the relationship between Max and Chloe grows to the end of the game, how you as Max never want to leave her again and would do everything for each other. At the end of the game it was really not a hard choice for me, I saved Chloe (I believe the proper phrase is Bae over Bay). I did not want to give up everything I built up during the progression of the game.

I really felt like I was part of this world and now that I've finished it, it leaves a hole in my heart. Like that sad feeling you have when you end a good book or another game for never returning to this world for the first time again, but then twice as bad. I even took the time to mail DONTNOD to thank them for making this wonderful game, which I have never done before. Never had a game such an impact on me as Life is Strange.

So now that I finished this game and sitting here with this sad and empty feeling, I wanted to know what you guys did after finishing the game? How did you deal with the ending and what did you like most?

If you've come this far, thanks for reading this! I already feel better just writing this up and putting it out here.

PS: As a sidenote I was wondering if you think the decision to hurt the dog had the most one-sided outcome from all the possible choices. When I ended that Ep, 93% of the people chose not to hurt Pompidou (great name still), as did I.
/////////////////////
just bought all episodes but i dont see episode 1 in ps3 store. how do you open the game?
/////////////////////
I'm really curious about what you would think about this
I loved it some much I would like to play a sequel, but on the other hand I would be too scared to be disappointed. 
So guys, what do you think ?
/////////////////////
I got this game on Monday through the ultimate game sale on Xbox One. I played episode one Tuesday, and played all the rest over the last 12 hours. Can I just say, damn! That was absolutely amazing. I don't think I have ever played a game that made me so puzzled, and happy, and sad, and thrilled, and depressed, and (every emotion) all at once. I can't give enough huge props to the devs for this game. I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this studio and especially any sequels.

I wanna make Chloe and max and sims and I don't know what Chloe would want to do.

Gonna be working on a lot other things. So forced organization is gonna be happening soon. Yaaaaaay.

Well, as we know LIS kinda blew up last year. They got one or two nominations. Won some awards and got recognition but whatever. What made Life Is Strange a compelling game?

I see there's new people coming on this reddit and posting about their experiences and fanmade creations. I figured I'll share my story. I've been working on this story for little over two months ago. I always have a few ideas about a "Life is Strange" sequel. Being I'm a newbie writer, this is my first fan fic/creative writing I've ever done. Honestly, this is the first creative work I ever put online to the public. I'm definitely not a skilled writer, but a universe like Life is Strange is too difficult to pass on, in terms of creatively. I do hope more and more people get inspired with fan made creations and there is lots of it in this community. I didn't know how dedicated I'll be, but you never know until you try. So far I've written a lot, and doesn't seem like it'll stop anytime soon. Anyways, this tidbit was intended to hopefully encourage people that were like me, self conscious or never written before but thinking about writing a story.

Premise of the story: Post-Bay Ending, Alternate/Multiple Universes revolving between the two main characters Max and Rachel. Similar darker themes explored in Life is Strange. Different/New powers. Friendship/Relationship as well. And my take on Rachel Amber and her connection.

I've been told the story is a little on the darker side. Understandably, might be a little turn off after such an emotional coaster ride like LiS. :P But hopefully that doesn't deter you too much. It isn't quite "PriceField" fan fic, but I absolutely respect and acknowledge their relationship. Anyways, feel free to check it out.

If you want to discuss anything LiS/story ideas/themes/theories feel free to PM me in Reddit or FF.
/////////////////////
Upon playing the game a second time, focusing on getting all the optional photos, I was wondering if anyone has a camera like hers, and if it's good? I love the Polaroid type cameras and would like suggestions about which one to get? Thanks for reading! :)
/////////////////////
I have just finished Episode 3 (holy shit), but I find myself wondering about the outcomes of certain choices I did not make. I guess this is intentional, the game is after all about making choices, but I'd simply like to know the could-have's.

I assume some choices only matter in the short term, like whether you water the plant, while other matter over several episodes, such as the Kate-situation.

It would be quite time-consuming to try all combinations of major choices just to see what the outcome is, especially across episodes, so I wonder, is there any short summary of the outcomes to various choices?
/////////////////////
In Chapter 5, when your going through the dream part, be careful when you use your rewind to avoid the flashlights. IThis happened not inly one  got stuck in an infinite loop of the black and white screen effect that plays when your spotted. this literally happened to me 4 different times. I had to restart from last checkpoint (Which, of course, was at the very beginning.) every time. It totally ruined my mood when I reached the ending. was pissed. I'm not sure if this can happen on console, because I played on PC.

Looking to buy the full game during the sale. Do I get the full game if I download the demo, and then purchase the season pass? It's somewhat strange that Ep1 is £3.99, whereas Ep2-5 is £5.59.

This is in regards to the "Bae vs Bay" discussion. Can you really trust Chloe's decision to accept death in order to save Arcadia Bay? In the alternate timeline, Chloe was only okay with death after spending a day with Max. That extra happiness from having fun with her best friend is what she needs to happily pass away. 

However, if you were to go back in time to save Arcadia Bay, Chloe dies before ever spending time with Max. Chloe never has time to go on any of those crazy adventures with Max or find any kind of redemption in life. In fact she would die shortly after being drugged by Nathan. If you were to ask this Chloe her opinion on living or dying, given her current position in life, she'd probably be in favor of sacrificing Arcadia Bay.

So with this in mind, is it really right for Max to accept Chloe's desire to sacrifice herself? It seems to me like the decision to save Chloe or save Arcadia Bay should not include Chloe's input at the end of the game as that Chloe will cease to exist and be replaced by a Chloe that will never know what could have been.

TLDR: Chloe at the end of the game is making the decision to die for another Chloe who would want to live instead.

I have tried everything, reinstalling, attempting to run as administrator, and following the steps listed on the Steam Community thread for this issue. Going into the program files and installing everything manually like suggested still leaves me stuck with the game never launching. The only thing I have noticed is each time I go to uninstall the game where it is supposed to say the amount of space it's taking up (such as 1GB) is instead says "Unavailable" leading me to believe it's not installing properly, however I have no clue as to why. Any troubleshooting steps would be greatly appreciated because I am looking forward to playing what looks to be an amazing game.
/////////////////////
As you can probably gather from the title, I just finished playing the game. That experience was definitely one of, if not the most emotionally driven games I've ever played, and it was definitely the one that made me feel the biggest emotional connections to characters. I felt impacted by what I did, and what I didn't/couldn't do. 

I couldn't save Kate, and I admit, I cried, because I really like her, not just as a character, but as a person, and I wanted to help her. Needless to say, when I went back and saw her alive again, I was pretty overwhelmed and ended up crying again... When I saw Chloe after the accident at the end of episode 3, I had to stop playing because it was too much for me, just seeing her like that. When she asked me to end her pain, I did it, and I cried, once again, and again when I went back to the real Chloe. 

Finding Rachel, I couldn't bear seeing Chloe like that, it was too real, I felt horrible seeing her realize one of her closest friends had died. I wanted to get Nathan for what he did. But then when the plot twist happened, I felt betrayed, dishonoured, and angry. Fast forward through the nightmare sequence and all of the alternate realities, I realized that I wouldn't be able to take whatever was planned for me. When that ended up being Chloe or Arcadia Bay, I put my controller down, put my head in my hands, and just let it all out. When I got it together, I told Chloe that I was sorry, then went back to the past one last time. Everything that followed was really hard for me, to be frank (pun intended) especially the funeral, as they are. 

So, in conclusion, I am still emotionally wrecked by this game, and figure that I will be any time I think about it. Now, I'm going to wait until I feel like I'm up for a second playthrough, and I am going to save Kate, and do whatever I missed in the first one. 

Also, Dontnod, you made a hella good game. One of the best I've ever played.

When you bump into him at the Vortex Club party did you find him creepy there? Remember, this was before it was reveled that Jefferson was the main bad guy, but there was something off during the Vortex Club scene. I suspected Jefferson, but he really made my skin crawl in that scene.

Man I am just getting later and later with these topics. Let's try to get slightly earlier from today on. They will run into each other but who cares.

How does the music in Life Is Strange impact you? It can be purely from a game perspective or even in how it changed your taste in music. Just talk about how the music in LIS impacted you.

I'm a woman and for once I would like to play a game with a male protagonist who is not a robotic, super soldier, killing machine. (I mean, don't get me wrong, these games can be fun but a change would be nice) He doesn't have to be "effeminate" either (not that it would be bad, I'm just saying), I believe you can make masculine characters that are humanized.
/////////////////////
[SPOILERS AHEAD]

We all know that this game has some incredible moments, and has made a lot of people shed tears that have never cried because of a video game before. The game has lots of incredible heart breaking moments. Kate's suicide, Chloe's alternate timeline and the choice you have to make too in it, and of course the final decision. These moments are all great, and all of them made me cry, but crying because of a video game isn't exactly something new to me. But there is one thing this game made me feel that no other game has ever managed. It made me feel sick to my stomach. 

I've played all sorts of horror games, and I'm not saying they don't succeed in making me scared, but none of them have ever made me think I might get sick. They've made me cringe or jump or even shake but never sick to my stomach.

Not many people talk about it, but one of my favourite moments in the game is when you find the dark room. It's all set up perfectly. There's a sense that something isn't right the very moment you find the hatch. There's no rushing you into the dark room either, which adds to the suspense of what you're going to find. And the juxtaposition of having this brand new, clean and very sterile bunker under an old family farm, was brilliant and far more nefarious than it would have been if it were some modern building you broke into.

When I first walked into the dark room my stomach was in knots. The very layout of the darkroom was enough to make me feel uneasy. You come down to a small survival like setup with plastic sheets separating you from what's just around the corner and lets your mind wander with the possibilities until you round that corner. 

I remember playing this moment and sitting up in my chair thinking "this is only going to get worse." and it did. When you explore that oddly sterile atmosphere and come across the binders... I honestly thought about pausing the game and leaving it until I felt better, but the narrative was too good to stop. I NEEDED to know just as much as Chloe even though you know just as much as Chloe does, that it's not gonna be good. 

The entire moment from finding the hatch to the moment they find Rachel's body was the most intensely disturbing and surreal moment I've experienced in a game. They didn't go the Hollywood route and make it overdramatic, it felt real. Even the reactions from Max and Chloe were perfect. When they dig up Rachel, Max covers her own mouth like she's doing to be sick while Chloe is waling and everything is so perfectly raw and human.

This game put me on an emotional roller coaster and really pulled out all the stops. You had the sweetest moments mixed in with the most surreal and heartbreaking moments which is what life really is. It's all of that. I'm glad that Dontnod didn't stick to one emotional aesthetic, they really knew how to imitate what real life is. Life is strange.
/////////////////////
Has anyone else had LiS Dreams? I Have not had one for a long time until last night. Before, I'd have dreams for a week straight after playing the episodes. Well..... I had a dream that I met Chloe irl. Smart, beautiful, funny, and charming. As all good dreams are, they have to come to an end. We said our good byes and I woke up. Sad. Back in reality. 
/////////////////////
Just finished it and not gunna lie, I cried a bit when I sacrificed Chloe. The music just did the game so well in so many ways and honestly will be downloading the soundtrack pretty soon. But honestly, I'm just wondering who else thought it was ridiculous to be getting the optional photos in episode 5. After I finished episode 4, I just had to go finish episode 5 because that was too much of a cliffhanger to go to sleep with. I got all the photos from episodes 2-4 on the first try, but honestly, it was a bit unrealistic to get the optional photos in episode 5. I was too wrapped around in the plot and gameplay to actually stop and take the pictures. Especially in the nightmare? I had to keep rewinding time because all I did was get caught and feel the anxiety rush through my veins. There was no way I could have gotten them on the first try. Just so many people to avoid, not enough time, and it was too dark to be getting everything together just for a picture. Can't help but be a completionist and have this urge to get all the pictures for the achievements, but the nightmare sequence is going to be the toughest for me. Anyone got it all on the first try?
/////////////////////
I have bad hearing and lots of games don't have a dialogue box when there is talking, I was wondering if this game has any? 
/////////////////////
If Chloe and Max were able to find Nathan after finding out about Rachel's body, and Chloe was able to shoot Nathan and kill him as she wanted, probably the worst thing in the world would happen. Chloe and Max would go to jail and Jefferson would never be caught for his crimes. I guess that goes to show how dumb and stupid these girls' actions in E4 were.
/////////////////////
... I could rewind back to the beginning of the Steam summer sale, just so I could buy this again and play it for the first time. Incredible.

Since it is such a story-driven experience set at a relatable time in people's lives, I would recommend Life is Strange even to non-gamers who are looking to jump in. Get your Netflix-binge-watching friend to plop on the couch with a controller and play this, where they can choose an outcome to the story. I'm shocked this game doesn't have more attention.

/////////////////////
So i've been thinking about getting a LiS tattoo, and i have an idea in my head of something symbolizing Max, Chloe and Rachel.  
the thought so far is something just using symbols from those 3.  
current thought is blue butterfly, chloe's bullet necklace, and rachel's feather earring.  
so....i'm looking for stand alone pics of these three things and/or suggestions/ideas/thoughts. 
/////////////////////
Joyce told me to clean my plate but I left the house just leaving it there.

Talk about triggering my OCD, I didn't leave any room with a light that I can switch off as switched on. Come to think of it, it's quite unwise for Chloe and Max to leave the Dark Room without putting Rachel's folder back to where it was.

Max is not so thoughtful as a detective when it comes to covering her tracks. I hope in the sequel, we are given the option to do so.
/////////////////////
Hi! I bought this game during the steam summer sale and I'm really getting into it, but for some reason I'm able to see the fps counter in the bottom right corner of the screen and it's really distracting. 

How can I get rid of it?


EDIT

I found out what was wrong, shadowplay was on apparently, even though I didn't turn it on, which is weird.
Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
/////////////////////
It would be too predictable if LIS 2 is about time travel again and we would already know there would be negative consequences like the tornado. Instead I hope the new protagonist will have some other superpower. 

I also want a new story with new characters, but I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of familiar faces as backround characters maybe.
/////////////////////
This might be an entry in your skull covered diary. I hope it suits you well. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't breath. Everythink is meaningless. I can't smile. Everything is painful. I can't fell. Everything is empty. I'm 19 years old. My bones feel weak. My mind is broken. I loved so much and got nothing in return. Only anger. My dad left me. My bestfriend left me. My love left me. My soul left me. 

I stroll through darkness and can't see anyhting. But I don't care. I might step into oblivion and my heart will be buried. But I don't care. I stare at the ceiling and pretend to be alive. Smoke is filling my lungs. It feels like my wings will burst into thousands of small splinter of glass. They cut me. Blood is rushing down my body. It blends with my rage. You said, that I'm your unique butterfly. You still left me. You drove on purpose into the sun, which burned you to ashes. 

Deadness covers me. I'm exhausted. I can't fight anymore. I'm drowning, although I'm so light and hollow. The water is burning on my skin. I'm exhausted. My star is imploding. My universe is shrinking. I'm exhausted. I'm alone.

A shy light is reaching out for me. It glows so immense, that it blinds my eyes. It's warm, familiar. It's pure. It's full of life. I already met it, a long time ago. I lost it. Even I didn't know, I searched it. I finally found it. It destroys my cage, under thunderous applaus.

We are sitting on a bench. Destiny smiles at us. I look into your sky-blue eyes. Your pupils dilate, while we can hear waves, the ocean, the freedom. You are kissing my soul. The sun ist melting. I open my lips, but my heart is speaking:

"I won't ever forget about you."






/////////////////////
Ok, hear me out, I think Nathan was horrible and definitely deserved jail. I still feel sorry for him because it was apparent to me that he felt bad about the things he did. You can feel sorry about someone and still think their actions weren't justified. 
/////////////////////
I'm sure doing a lot of topics on choices. Mostly because that's what first comes to my mind when I am like four hours late on posting up the daily topic.

Welp let's talk about some choices that most of us made that we didn't want to. It can be something as simple as committing a sin against the choice of bacon. Or letting a character get the shit kicked out of them.
/////////////////////
I know that Nathan probably killed Rachel on accident, when he screwed up the dosage of the drug as he was trying to mimic Jefferson. But despite killing someone, he still tries it again on Chloe (which is really fucked up btw, one would think he would have learned and realised how dangerous it is). But this time he wants to make sure not to overdose her, so he reduces the dose but he ends up not using enough and that's why Chloe is able to wake up relatively quickly and manages to escape. I don't know, just an interesting detail I have realised. It's scary to think that Chloe could have easily ended up just like Rachel if Nathan was a little bit less careful with the dosage.
/////////////////////
I'm a huge fan of this. I bought it this weekend, started playing sunday and was off work today and finished it. The game is my first "interactive movie" type game and I loved it. The music, the atmosphere and the "feel" of the game was amazing.

I decided to not reload my game and just finished it with what I had. I ended up not being able to save Kate. I thought it was impossible to and I just answered wrong and when she stepped off that roof I was just like W T F. I didnt even know it was possible to finish her to till I saw the end of chapter screen. And the ending of episode 3.

The games moments like that were the most impactful. I loved the little bits and extra's that were available if you wen't looking. The sign in the boys dorm "samuel = dexter" cracked me up. The graffiti about katie, and the stuff in the boys locker room etc. "u alyssa play hard 2 get if nobody wants 2 get alyssa". The random school shit just made me laugh so much. The amount of random film quotes and references in the game and school are hilarious (firefly's "aim to misbehave" in the diner is one of my faves). BUELLER. BUELLER (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4zyjLyBp64)

I loved that one moment you're helping a girl dodge a gun, the next you're helping someone dodge a puddle. I loved the random use of Max's power and I loved the characters. Sure they're tropes, they're something you've read or seen before a million times, but so is every movie book or film. It helps you understand the characters quicker and just get on with it. My personal favourite was the homeless lady I like to call Roberta Sparrow (because of Donnie Darko.) I was totally ignorant of that asshole teacher until episode 4 when it suddenly struck me that he was actually dodge as shit. I totally missed recognising his car in the evidence though even though I saw him and the principle having an argument in it at the end of episode 2 or 3. Also listening to the phone call he takes when you're about to enter the classroom when Victoria and Nathan are sitting on your desk its obvious something is going on. (OH and its called a fucking DARK ROOM. like where photos (or the plot and characters) are DEVELOPED.)

I love Donnie Darko and I loved the ending of the game. Both of them (that bit I reloaded) and I see the game as one giant tribute to that movie especially. Obviously butterfly effect and even the jacket also seem to come through clearly and then it also pays tribute to pretty much every time travel book, film and media that is referenced in the game itself. I've read so many time travel books (all you zombies, by his own bootstraps) and I loved how the game took a concept that perhaps wasn't new or unseen and showed it to you maybe in a way you hadn't seen before. Could I see what was going to happen with Chloe's dad? Yes. Yes I could. Did it mean the impact was lessened? No. Not really.

The voice acting was pretty good, I didn't really care about the lip syncing issues and I loved the soundtrack. The music moments when you're chilling and the cutscenes were playing were some of the best bits in there and nothing got me more amped to play that the "previously on life is strange" segments. I love the feeling of using your power to get a conversation JUST RIGHT. I hated when I tried everything I could and STILL FAILED. I couldn't warn Victoria the bitch just wouldn't listen to me. I loved the touch when you're talking to Frank and Max is like "listen Chloe this doesn't go so well." I wished there could be a few more moments like that.

Does the game have issues? Yeah it does. Does it make the game any better that Chloe is sort of bi and that Max is sort of too? No. It just makes it sort of more appealing to teen boys IMO. Does that weird bit in the middle of episode 5 really make sense? No. Not really. Does it stop you from enjoying the whole experience? Not me. (In Donnie Darko lore it does kind of make sense in that you could argue that the world and manipulated dead and living would do whatever it could to get the person to make the decision they need to make and that everybody dies alone).

Its one of the best "gaming experiences" I've had in a long while. Really really good. I just don't know if its worth replaying from the start now that I know the ending. I just get the feeling I'd get bored trying to make random decisions just to see what they would do. But it was a damn cool ride while it was happening. 

Things that remind me of Life is Strange :

Donnie Darko  (obviously)  
Butterfly effect  (obviously)  
The jacket  
Groundhog Day 

By his bootstraps  
All you zombies  
All the literature mentioned

Happy Town (Tv Show cancelled)  
Twin Peaks  
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (chloe and the obvious dark room etc)
Buffy the vampire slayer (just the high school vibe)  
Haven (the feel of the town)
/////////////////////
**Preface (skip if you just want to read the sequel ideas)**  
I bought this game on Friday and finished it last night at 2 am. It is now one of the best ~~games~~ works of fiction I've ever ~~played~~ experienced. No piece of media has ever shaken me this much, and certainly not since Undertale has a video game touched me emotionally, which definitely speaks volumes about the medium as a whole. The final choice left me out of breath while I pondered the possibilities, and I sat back in awe as I watched the credit roll.   

On a personal level, Max is someone I can relate to. A lot. I've moved away from a place and come back, watching how things have changed over time. I'm shit at keeping in touch. Hell, I even sort of dress like her. But in all honesty, I've never really had a friend like Chloe, someone with whom I can just pick back up where we left off. I think this is part of what informed my decision to save her. And also because the alternative (letting her die feeling like the universe has treated her like crap and completely unaware that her friend is in the same room) is simply too heartbreaking. I don't think I could have handled it.   

**Sequel goals**   
The story of Max and Chloe and Arcadia Bay is a closed book I have no desire to see reopened. After all, just look at J.K. Rowling ;) To that end, I think it's important that were there to be a season two, or a sequel, it would have to *wholly differentiate* itself from the first while still keeping the essence of what Life is Strange actually is. The core theme is that actions, even the seemingly minuscule ones, have consequences. The core mechanics are arguably rewinding time and making choices. 

**Setting and A E S T H E T I C**  
(Please bear with me as this may seem completely crazy but I assure you I've put a non-zero amount of thought into it.)  
In a stark contrast to the small-town, indie-film feel of the first, with its gentle colours and low-key music, the sequel should wildly careen into the opposite direction: **IN DA HOOD.** That seems silly but I'd like to see gritty, hip-hop soundtracked sequel borrowing from things like Straight Outta Compton, 8 Mile and the music of Kendrick Lamar (that last one will be important). The street replaces Blackwell Academy, and the protagonist is pulled not between cliques or clubs, but gangs.   

**That's cool/meh/utter shite, but why? (Warning: slight non-LiS related tangent)**   
I was thinking about how Life is Strange is a coming-of-age story. As someone who is in that time of their life, I got to thinking about similar stories. Almost instinctively my mind jumped to one of my favourite albums of all time, Kendrick Lamar's *Good Kid, M.A.A.D City* (sorry, TPAB). Set in Compton in the early 2000s and based on his experiences growing up there, it tells the story of KDot (based on Kendrick himself) and his struggle as a young man in that kind of environment. But like LiS, it also shows that actions have consequences.   

For example, in one song KDot gets pressured into breaking, entering and subsequently stealing, all the while cognisant of the fact that he's only doing it because he's with his homies. 

*What if he had a choice?*

The whole plot gets kickstarted because KDot chooses to pursue a girl named Sherane, but he gets jumped by her homies. KDot's friends learn about this and plot revenge, but in the scuffle his close friend Dave gets killed.   

*What if he had a choice?*  

Towards the end, a kind old woman senses their anger and sets them on the path to Jesus, causing KDot to repent and exit the gang lifestyle for good.   

*What if he had a choice?* 

At this point I hope you see what I'm getting at. I think an LiS-themed game in this setting would be a way to explore a *different variety* of choices and outcomes. Naturally we have to admit that it won't have the spark of the first, but that doesn't mean that it can't be emotionally impactful. And while I've used the album as a way to show potential choice points, in reality there are so many narrative possibilities that I'm sure others can think of. 

**Mechanics**  
I think it's undeniable at this point that the gameplay of LiS is defined by its rewind mechanic. So let's keep that. But I had an idea that instead of being able to rewind through photos, the protagonist can rewind using music. If a particular song is playing during a pivotal scene, the two are inextricably linked. So the protagonist can listen to that song later, focus on it and go back to the moment when they heard it  So far, very similar to the photos.  

But while it's unfeasible for Max to whip out her camera frequently, it is very easy for someone to change a song on a player, listen to it while something's happening, and save it for later use. Now you have a whole library full of different points in time, something that could be put to use in puzzles or intense drama scenes. I'm not a game designer, so I'm not inventive enough to have thought of clever ways to use these multiple rewind points. I will say that I was occasionally annoyed by how I wasn't given a choice of what point to snap back to, being limited instead by these little dots in the spiral. Sometimes I just wanted to go back to a specific conversation point instead of having to slog through the bits leading up to it again.

**Conclusion**  
If you made it all this way, thank you for reading what I had to say. I just wanted to get it out there and see what others thought! I'd go mad if I kept in my head without sharing it to anyone. So here are some closing discussion question to mull over: 

* How would you be satisfied with a Life is Strange sequel? 
* Should there even be a sequel? 
* What would you keep from the original? 
* What would you change?

I just can't let this thing go, can I?

A while ago, I posted a thread here on chapter eighteen... and now here we are, at entry twenty-one. Looks like this game had more of an effect on me than I'd like to admit.

Perhaps you remember the premise: Max lives, Chloe lives, the bay burns, but someone else out there can manipulate time--and that someone is you, buddy.

So, for those of you that still care: here it is. Criticize fiercely to your heart's content. Or don't. Your choice.
/////////////////////
So it's around 5 in the morning my time, but I finished Life is Strange and man, this was such an amazing experience. This game handled very serious and dark topics really well. The characters were all really well done. The music was really amazing. And the major choices as you progressed further got really hard to make; especially THOSE moments from chapters 4 &amp; 5. The end of the game and my final choice was so heartbreaking. Thank you Dontnod for making such a great game and I can't wait to see what you guys make next!

As it is last day of the Steam Summer sales, and i guess i will finish LIS very soon as i am so soaked into the story. i need this kind of "novel stories" to read after work.

I found [one on AO3](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5210672). [Also available on [FF.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11591289/1/Life-is-Stranger)]

Seriously. They talk about some really cool stuff including the community. Cool to see all the different parts of making a game as good as this. 
/////////////////////
So I stumbled across Oxenfree this week browsing the PS4 store. It is an Indie from two Cousins and the debut of their newly founded studie. Both are Disney and Telltale veterans and you can totally tell this.

It's the story of a group of five high-school teenagers (3 girls, 2 guys) and is a round up of grow-up story, supernatural thriller and 80s horror dramas. Game time is around four hours.
I have to think about LIS so often so far I played. Choices also really seems to matter on this one. And the soundtrack - even though "just" electric, is outstanding. 

Make sure to take a look onto it. And I hope you can enjoy it as much as I am currently do. Also it is on sale on PS4 store and Steam at the moment. Don't know about Xbox.

http://store.steampowered.com/app/388880/
/////////////////////
It was an interesting and overall great experience. I'm very much into good story-telling over hardcore gameplay, so this was a real treat to play through.

I wasn't able to connect very well with the characters, including Max, so I didn't really feel sad or deeply-involved at any point in the game. But that's completely me, not the game (always been poor at empathy). It's unfortunate, since from what I've seen a lot of people got pretty attached to the characters.

That said, there were a lot of things I enjoyed about this game. Probably the biggest is the atmosphere. 

The environment, sounds, music, clothing, landscape, etc all felt outstandingly done. There were many places in the game where I just felt like taking a stroll past the scenery. 

The characters were well-done, as they should be in any story-focused game. Playing through to the end and seeing how much the relationships between Max, Chloe, Victoria, Nathan, Warren, etc changed made it feel like they were all just tentative, overly-self-conscious teenagers, rather than static cliches.

I don't really mind the ending. A lot of people complained about their choices not mattering in the end, and didn't like the fact that the "Save Arcadia" option (which I chose) was basically a giant reset button. Though I did wish the endings would've come as a result of your choices, I felt like I enjoyed my experience, and that's what matters to me. 

I'll always remember that part in the game where Max and Chloe are lying on the bed and listening to Lua by Bright Eyes. One of my favourite moments in any game I've played as of yet.
/////////////////////
Whenever Nathan speaks, he just reminds me of Draco from HP. They both come from rich and prestigious families with dark secrets, they both have asshole fathers, they're both "manipulated", even their attitude is very similar. 

I swear at some point Nathan says: "My dad is gonna do something about it" and this was just so obvious that I swear it could ne intentional. However, I must admit Draco was significantly less violent. 
/////////////////////
If anyone you know has been wanting to pick up the game on pc, now is the time! It appears to be only $1.99 per episode!

As someone who watches this kind of films, I got a lot of references: Nekromantik, Battle Royale , the Cannibal Holocaust. 

Not that I really hold it against him, many people are curious about this kind of things, but I thought it was interesting. I wonder if he really liked them or if he just wanted to impress Max (I watched the Cannibal Holocaust and I laughed, muahahaha)

Things would become a little more weird if he mentioned something like 120 days of Sodom though.

Can I just say that the playlist in this game is amazing, it fits the game so well.

So well in fact that I cannot listen to mountains without tearing up 😭
/////////////////////
I finished the game yesterday and I'm still in a state between happiness and sadness. Happiness, because I could be part of this adventure. Sadness, because my journey is over. I felt so connected to this world, it's people and it's flair, that it even bumped me out of reality.

I feel like I found new friends. I feel like I lost old friends. It showed me, that there are still people who care. It showed me, that there is still some magic left in the world. It's bittersweet, because it's not real. Only in my head. That's why I can't stop thinking about it. I don't want to see my illusion die.

The people who developed and created this piece of art are my everday heroes. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I know it's pathetic, but I think Max and Chloe gave me something, that nobody else could. I'm proud, that I finished the game, even at is was nearly tearing me apart. I owed something. To myself and Max. 

I feel like I'm stuck on the moon. Im all alone at this beautiful place, seeing the stars, the endless darkness. I can see the earth, my only desire. But I won't get there. Never. All that's left are my memories.

I had to share my thoughts, even there is no purpose. I hope this is ok. Thank you for listening.

/////////////////////
First off, I AM ABOUT TO SPOIL EVERY MAJOR PLOT POINT IN THE GAME. If you haven't played it--or if you're curious about anything that you're saving for a future playthrough--you'll want to avoid this post.

This is a LONG post with some thoughts on color symbolism regarding a major dichotomy in this game: destiny vs. free will. I just finished my second playthrough, so I'll admit there are probably many here who know more about the game than I do. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter as well.

Also, I did a quick search and didn't see anything on this before, but it's possible that I missed something. Sorry if this has already been discussed before.

There’s a lot of debate on the symbolism of color in Life is Strange. There seem to be two colors that stand out, and they’re very specific shades of blue and red. These colors are seen in the first conflict in the game (Chloe’s hair and Nathan’s jacket), opposing each other and setting up the rest of the game. As many people have already pointed out, these two specific shades are opposite each other on the color wheel. With the two colors in obvious opposition, it seems like they represent a dichotomy. If that’s true, that dichotomy would run through the entire game and we’d keep seeing it pop up throughout.

There’s also been a lot of debate over what dichotomy, what conflict is most important in Life is Strange. There are the common answers of life and death, good versus evil, but I don’t think things are so cut and dry in this game. The dichotomy I see as the main conflict of the game is that of destiny versus free will. People have criticized the ending as a simple binary choice; but when the central conflict of destiny versus free will is recognized, this is really the only way to end the game. Do I undo my meddling with time and let destiny have its way by sacrificing Chloe, or do I choose to defy destiny and further exert my free will by saving her one last time? This dichotomy can also be more loosely interpreted as the choice between accepting your fate or choosing to impose your will on others to violate the natural order of things. More on that later.

So here’s what I think: that shade of bright blue represents destiny, and that shade of bright red represents free will. Now, I’m not saying everything that’s blue is destiny and everything that’s red is free will--we’re talking about very specific shades of these colors that keep popping up throughout the game.

Our first clue is the blue butterfly that flies into the bathroom in the beginning of the game. I believe this butterfly represents destiny itself. When it shows up, Max takes a picture which becomes the focal point of the most important decision in the game: the moment when she chooses to save Chloe. In the end, if Max chooses to let destiny win, she goes back to this picture of the blue butterfly and uses it to set the timeline right. 

Our next clue is the reaction to that. Max sees Chloe get shot, which is her destiny, but she rewinds time in order to stop it. She stops it how? By pushing the big red button. That’s right, that bright red fire alarm is in direct opposition to the destiny blue butterfly that just showed up, and Max exerts her free will against destiny by pushing it. 

So, going back to that first conflict, does this mean that Chloe represents destiny and Nathan represents free will? Well, not quite. What I think it means is that Chloe is marked by destiny and Nathan is marked by free will.

Now, initially, I thought Chloe might represent free will, because she has a do-what-you-want attitude and generally disregards what others say. But Chloe actually doesn’t have a lot of control over what’s happening to her. In fact, Chloe’s less-than-noble traits are most likely the result of a loss of power over her own life. That’s a pretty common psychological phenomenon.

Chloe’s had a tough life; but most of the things that happened to her weren’t a result of someone’s malicious intent--they were more like forces of nature. William was killed in a freak car accident. She needs a ton of money, not only to pay Frank back, but also to fix her truck, pay off her parking tickets, and just get out of Arcadia Bay. She had no control over Joyce’s marriage to David, and has no control over the paranoia and aggression that his service left him with. Even in the alternate timeline, she had no control over her accident and eventual failing respiratory system. Life just happened to her.

And furthermore, we see throughout the game that Chloe accepts her fate. In the end, she realizes it was her destiny to die and accepts that. But even before then, we see her graffiti everywhere, saying things like, “I want to die,” “Just gotta let go,” “One day your life will flash before your eyes,” and “Please go ahead and kill me.” Even before she realizes what her fate is, she’s resigned to it. And those little pyramid things with the eye? You see them everywhere. I think they represent the eye of destiny, watching events unfold. They’re all drawn by Chloe.

Oh, and do you remember the big red sign in Chloe’s room? The one that says, “WRONG WAY”? I rest my case.

As we find out in the end, Nathan has also had a pretty tough life, but for completely different reasons. Nathan’s problems are the result of people imposing their will on him. Sean Prescott is forcing Nathan into his legacy of whatever it is that they’re doing (which most likely involves imposing their will on others). Mark Jefferson is forcing Nathan to conform to his image. Nathan accidentally killed Rachel with an overdose and is consumed with guilt about something he never intended to do. When we first meet Nathan, he’s frantically trying to convince himself that he holds power, although it’s very clear that he doesn’t believe it. Then, when Chloe comes in and tries to impose her will on him, he pulls out a gun and shows his true fears: “I’m so SICK of people trying to control me!”

Like Chloe, Nathan’s destructive behavior is a result of a complete loss of power in his life. He tells Max, “Nobody tells me what to do. Not my parents, not the Principal, or that whore in the bathroom.” But, as we find out, everyone tells him what to do, and he can’t escape it. In episode five, he finally accepts this, as is evidenced in his voicemail to Max: “I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt Kate or Rachel, or... didn't want to hurt anybody. Everybody... used me.” In the end, Nathan is killed by Mark for not conforming to his will.

But these two colors don’t just show up on Nathan and Chloe--they’re everywhere, and they carry their associations with them.

Many of the things that happened to Chloe also happened to Joyce. Joyce’s hairclip is destiny blue to show that she was also marked by destiny, but in a lesser way than Chloe. Similarly, the Two Whales Diner t-shirt is blue, and the sign and logo for the diner are blue (although a slightly different shade). When destiny’s rage in the form of a tornado sweeps through the town, the last place you visit is the Two Whales diner.

If you saved Kate, you may have noticed a particularly disturbing bit of graffiti in the Two Whales Diner that says, “Kate should have jumped.” This is written in--you guessed it--destiny blue. After you meddled with time again to change Kate’s destiny, destiny sends you a little reminder of what should have happened. If you failed to save Kate, destiny still taunts you with the graffiti, “You killed Kate.”

Destiny blue pops up on other characters as well--usually characters that don’t hold a lot of power. Kate’s marker is destiny blue, as is Alyssa’s nail polish.

In contrast to blue, red, representing free will and opposition to destiny, is frequently associated with characters that hold a lot of power. Principal Wells has a coffee mug that’s red, and is shown wearing a red shirt in the beginning of the game. Nathan, whose family is very powerful and rich, has a red jacket throughout the game. Victoria is also seen wearing red in the beginning of the game.

Interestingly, just about every threat in the game is associated with the color red. The various threats which can be written on Max’s walls by either Victoria or Nathan are written in red. When Victoria writes the URL for Kate’s video on the mirror, it’s in red (and Victoria is wearing red when she writes it). When visiting the junkyard shack in the nightmare, you may have seen where you added your name to Rachel and Chloe’s. There’s now an ominous message written on top of the names, and it’s written in red. And Jefferson’s binders full of women are that same shade of red.

In episode three, we finally see some clothing that was owned by Rachel Amber. Most prominent is a red flannel shirt. This is a bit of foreshadowing of her fate: she was killed by others imposing their will on her. But it’s also very telling as to what Rachel’s life was like.

Rachel and Chloe were best friends when Chloe developed feelings for her. We don’t know the details, but we know that Rachel left without much of an explanation, and was scared to tell Chloe about her romantic involvement with Frank. What I think happened is that Chloe tested the waters a bit by hinting that she liked Rachel, but Rachel didn’t reciprocate. In short, Chloe tried to impose her will on Rachel. This drove her away and into Frank’s arms.

Rachel and Frank were involved for a while; but eventually, Frank did some undisclosed thing which scared Rachel, and he showed no signs of calming down. Rachel makes it clear that this is not the fault of the drugs, meaning it is the fault of Frank. Frank tried to impose his will on Rachel, and drove her away to the Vortex Club party.

And we know how that ends. Rachel was killed in the dark room and lives on in one of those red binders.

And then we have Max. Max is interesting in that, at the start of our story, she doesn’t know which camp she falls into. This is evidenced by two wristbands she wears: one red and one blue. Other than that, we don’t see her associated with either of those colors until the middle of season 3, where she puts on Rachel Amber’s red flannel shirt. When Chloe first shows Max the shirt, Max says something like, “I don’t think that’s my style,” to which Chloe responds, “You don’t have a style yet,” further evidencing this indecision.

When Max puts on Rachel’s red shirt, this symbolizes a change in her--not into someone marked by free will, as Nathan, but into an agent of free will. This comes right after her break-in to Blackwell Academy. Remember that she was apprehensive about the break-in and fixated on the consequences. It comes right before Max and Chloe go to break into Frank’s RV. In contrast to the break-in at Blackwell, Max isn’t apprehensive at all about breaking into Frank’s RV. In fact, in the diner before that, you have the option to do some pretty audacious things to Frank and Nathan, which she also seems to have little regard for. After putting the red shirt on, she’s a lot more comfortable asserting her free will.

But there’s still some shakiness with that change. Frank remarks that, while the shirt looked good on Rachel, it looks terrible on Max. Nathan, while he doesn’t outright say that he doesn’t like those clothes on Max, clearly reacts poorly to Max while she’s wearing them.

This scene leads into a big fight between Chloe and Max (destiny versus free will again), and that leads to Max making her biggest assertion of free will yet: traveling back in time to save William.

When Max travels back in time, you find that younger Max is wearing a shirt that is destiny blue. This is a flashback to a point in her life when she was powerless to stop destiny--in this case, the destiny of William, and subsequently Chloe. So, in that moment, she was also marked by destiny. But after she hides the keys, we’re treated to a little photo montage showing what changed. The most significant event is Chloe getting the car that results in her being paralyzed. You can see the truck in the background of the photo. It’s bright red, symbolizing Max’s choice to override destiny.

When you meet alternate-timeline Chloe, her blue hair is gone (which makes sense from a plot perspective); but notice that her breathing tube is still destiny blue. Even in this timeline, she’s marked by destiny: it’s her destiny to die, and destiny shows us exactly how it’s been working to do that with that little blue tube.

Max regrets her decision to change destiny and eventually changes things back to the way they were. When we see Max back in the original timeline, she’s no longer wearing red--she’s switched it back to a neutral black. She even says that she shouldn’t have meddled in time and swears off of it.

But when faced with the choice to save herself--and Chloe--Max goes through the most intense set of time jumps and meddling yet in episode 5. When she finally gets things in a state where she and Chloe are safe, we see she’s changed her t-shirt. It is, appropriately, bright red, symbolizing the power she holds, not only in her past time jumps, but in the upcoming major decision regarding whether to let destiny win or fight against it.

If Max chooses to embrace free will and save Chloe in the end, we’re treated to a scene of Max in her red t-shirt and Chloe driving off into the sunset. Take a look at the town’s wreckage. Blue and red pop up quite a bit. Notice that most of the things that are unscathed, like fire hydrants and a few newspaper stands, are red. Now, there are some red things that are destroyed, so free will took a few hits of its own. But just about everything that’s blue ends up getting destroyed in that ending, symbolizing free will’s triumph over destiny, though not without some casualties of its own.

If Max chooses to embrace destiny and sacrifice Chloe, we jump back to the bathroom where we were originally introduced to the destiny versus free will conflict. Notice how this scene ends: Nathan, the guy in the red jacket marked by free will, is arrested, symbolizing the shackling of free will by destiny. Mark is also arrested, and, while he’s not wearing red, we see a shot of him in jail with a large red drape in the background, symbolizing the same thing. At Chloe’s funeral, there’s a blue ribbon on the flower bouquet, and the blue butterfly makes another appearance and actually lands on Chloe’s coffin, bringing some closure to her story and letting us know that her destiny is complete right there and then. (Note: Warren and Frank are wearing bright red shirts at the funeral. I don’t know what this means.)

TL;DR - Bright blue and bright red in the game are symbolic of the struggle between destiny and free will in this game, which ends up being the game's main conflict. 
/////////////////////
I bought this game on the Steam sale and finished it a couple days ago, but I've been dealing with the aftermath of this game on a very personal level. I've fallen in love with the soundtrack and can't stop listening to it, and I keep watching the final ending scenes over and over. This game took me on a roller coaster of emotions and I have never ever, not in the 20 years of games I've been playing, reacted this way. By that, I mean to say that I actually cried several times, and no game has ever done that to me before. This is the same experience most people have had, so there's no reason to belabor this point. I do feel like I need to post something, though, since no one else I know has played this game, and how can I talk to them about it?

The scenes that killed me the most were the end of episode 2, when Kate committed suicide. I picked the wrong Bible verse and decided to stick with my decision, but the scene afterwards that shows her memorial and all that just cut me too deep. In 4 I accepted Chloe's request to end her life, and the scene that followed crushed me. And then, of course, at the end of 5, I sacrificed her for the town, and the scene that followed destroyed me, particularly when Max sat in the bathroom waiting for that gunshot.

Basically, this game was a heavy, depressing experience for me, and the constant reminders of Kate's death throughout the game made it even more difficult. But that is what made me love this entire thing, from beginning to end. Combine those emotions with the music and this was just incredible to me. I kept putting myself into Max's position and asking myself what I'd do if Chloe were my own best friend. And that's why these decisions ended up being so hard. Ending her life when she was paralyzed and sacrificing her at the end made me realize that these were absolutely the right choices. This isn't supposed to be a happy ending. This is supposed to be fucked up. 

Many people got very attached to Chloe, understandably, and refused to sacrifice her in the end. I get why that was, and I think I might be very tempted to do the same if she were my own best friend in real life, but there is a world beyond just you and your friend, and not taking that into consideration is a serious mistake, in my opinion. I had the hardest time giving her the overdose and sacrificing her at the end, but there are greater goods that come from it all, and that's why I love this game. You have to sit there and deal with these soul-crushing decisions that make you ball your eyes out, because you know that others who have no idea what you've gone through will benefit from this. Even if Chloe dies, all your experiences you had allow you to avenge Rachel in the end AND save the town, ensuring that her sacrifice and all the prior decisions you made were not in vain. 

All of this gets me thinking about Max's own well-being after she goes through all this. She must be psychologically devastated, particularly if she still has her powers and just chooses not to use them. And if she still has them, does there a come a point when she can no longer go back? Is there a limit to her travel distance? And if that's the case, what goes through her head when the day comes where she has to decide to either let time pass and be without Chloe forever or go back one more time and try it all again? All of this just tears me apart, and I think it has something to do with experiencing a few deaths in my own life and wondering what it would be like if you could go back and change things. Max gets that opportunity, but it turns out to be just as devastating, mostly to herself. 

Anyway, this is a very, very long post and I don't expect anyone to read it, but I had to just express this to others who have played it. This game has fucked me up good, and I look forward to making another run through in the near future.

[My previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4o4a4k/my_lock_screen/?st=iq48u5tw&amp;sh=1cd7394a) , where i promised i'd make this; sorry i'm very flipping lazy.

Ok, so to preface this, ; the device i did this on is an Iphone 5 Ios 8.1.3 jailbroken. (Yeah you need to have it jailbroken to be able to do this.)

Now before i start off the tutorial, you should know what you're working towards right?  
[Lock Screen](http://imgur.com/63oU9DL) ,[Various Home Screens](http://imgur.com/a/y6HCu) , by the time you're done you'll be using the sounds provided in the [mobile media kit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/40nedl/the_official_life_is_strange_mobile_media_kit_is/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) as system sounds ( plus an extra little sound: the guitar strum when you pick things up) and your phone will use the LiS in game font.Also , yes you can open your phone by sliding the whole to another universe.

If you're having trouble with the fonts read the section i wrote for them in the tutorial or pm me or reply with your question

Without further adieu 

------------------------------------------------TUTORIAL----------------------------------------------

**JAILBREAK**

The preliminary step is that you should have your phone jailbroken.  
I'm sure you can manage that on your own , google it or something , plenty of youtube videos and articles for it. There's also the very helpful [IOS 9.x jailbreak help](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/ios9jailbreakhelp)  (shout out to /r/jailbreak , really helpful community) , /r/jailbreak has posts for each specific IOS version's jailbreak , so if you run into trouble just search for the post. The gist of jailbreak is that you use [Pangu](en.pangu.io) for 9.1, 9.0.2, 9.0.1, and 9.0  and use [Taig](www.taig.com/en) for for 8.4, 8.3, 8.2, and 8.1.3 . 

**FONT**

The font is [Dudu Calligraphy](http://www.dafont.com/dudu-calligraphy.font) (DOWNLOAD IT FROM HERE) . The tweak i used for implementing it on the phone is BytaFont 2( 3 if you're on IOS 9) .I got it from the following repo.
&gt;http://apt.modmyi.com/

Add it to your sources in cydia if you don't have it already. Now download BytaFont 2/3( remember 2 for 8.x and 3 for 9.x) . See the file you're gonna download from the above link(Dudu.ttf ), isn't exactly gonna play nice with the BytaFont straight off the bat. What we're gonna do is install another tweak called 'BytaFont Tweak Mode' , this is gonna open up a new option in BytaFont called  , you guessed it, Tweak mode. If you're interested in the specifics , my understanding is that you need to convert a font file to be compatible with IOS , tweak mode allows you to circumvent this limitation and still use the font without conversion.

Now the installation part is done with , move back over to your pc. The next step is to move the file into the file directory where BytaFont stores custom font on your phone. This can be accomplished in a number of ways , there are plenty of file clients like Iexplorer and such , but i've personally never used them. I use SSH to connect with the phone and access it's directory. 

Now if you can access the directory yourself with whatever , skip the next two paragraphs

*Ifile*

Another way to access the file system is to install IFile from cydia and open a webserver , then just connect to the ip address from your browser. Honestly , i've never managed to get this to work and have been using SSH for much longer but others don't have problems with this so idk more power to you if you use this.

*SSH*

I use [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).(DOWNLOAD HERE) You ofcourse , are free to use any SSH client of your choice . Before we begin with the client side stuff , go back to cydia and download OpenSSH post haste if you don't already have it, after that's done connect both your pc and iphone to the same wifi if possible (if not possible then use a desktop file explorer like [ITools](http://pro.itools.cn/itools3_en)(which is what i sometimes use) , IFunbox , Iexplorer  and scrap the SSH plan ) , when they're both connected to the same wifi , i presume you're still in wifi settings on your phone; tap on the i next to your wifi name and read the address given for 'IP Address'., this is what you're going to use to connect to your phone (The address should be something like 192.168.1.106 for example). After you're done with this open up WinSCP , It should look something like [this](http://imgur.com/y2OIVl4) , in 'Host Name' , type your ip address i mentioned above. The username for ios devices is always 'root' , the password can be 'alpine' or 'dottie' depending on your IOS version . (I'm on 8.1.3 and my default was alpine)

Just click login after that, it should look something like [this](http://imgur.com/2ju0Hzn).

NOTE:Please install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/), this allows you to access the command line of the iphone through SSH. The reason this is essential is because you need to access the command line and change the default password otherwise people like me who spend way too much time on this shit can access your phone fairly easily if you share the same wifi with them. Now open PuTTY
fill in the ip and open it after that it should ask your username and pass. When you're done with this type 'passwd' and after that it should be fairly simple.

**TRANSFERRING FONT**

Ok , now back out till you're [here](http://imgur.com/XHeo4Aj) on the client ; from here , go to 'Library' &gt; BytaFont. Now this is where you're gonna put the file . Before you shove it in the rename it to 'Regular.ttf' and put that in a folder and name the folder 'DuduCalligraphy.font' and put this folder into BytaFont like [so](http://imgur.com/uiD1LuQ).

**APPLYING FONT**

Now open up BytaFont on your phone , go to tweak mode , tap enabled and then tap 'Font' under 'Base' and then select DuduCalligraphy in auto pair.

Respring aaaaannnnnnddddd VOILA! Your phone should have max's cherished chicken scratch font.

NOTE:My phone's music app can't handle the font so i put it as an exception in BytaFont , fortunately , it's the only thing that causes any trouble. So if some app starts making a fuss , just go to Apps under OVERRIDES and find the app making a fuss ; tap it and then turn off included.

ADDENDUM:You can use the font on your computer/browser too, much simpler on those really. Just get the FontChanger extension on Chrome and change the font from extension settings , change the font in windows settings too if you want the font to be system wide.

**CHANGING SYSTEM SOUNDS**

For the system sounds , I used the tweak SpringSounds from ModMyI , which i mentioned earlier in the wall of text.The files you want should be in the mobile media kit(UNFORTUNATELY , iphone's system files are in .caf format and mobile media kit has them in m4a which is incompatible so use the link ahead to download the ones i use in .caf, if you want to use something else from the media kit , be my guest BUT REMEMBER TO CONVERT TO .CAF)  and the guitar strum(when you pick up an object cough\*bottle*cough) file which i personally had to scour the game files for is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/el9lcwpu9n0bmwt/AABE8WRYT99TVa9DfDvWzw3oa?dl=0).(**DOWNLOAD MY ALREADY CONVERTED .CAF FILES HERE* )

Now back to WinSCP, this time you're going from the '\' to Library and then to [Application Support](http://imgur.com/LnGN5sN), from here you go to Springsounds &gt; Themes ; This is the folder where the magic will happen. You should see [these folders](http://imgur.com/lSIwgdF), now if you downloaded the folder i linked , just put them as follows if you want my setup

&gt;Diary_SMS_Send.caf --- &gt; SentMessage folder  
Diary_SMS_Receive.caf --- &gt;ReceivedMessage folder  
polaroid snap.caf ---&gt; PhotoShutter folder (This sounds so cool ,only problem is that i get the incredible urge to reach below my phone and shake a ploaroid pic every time i hear it go off)  
pickupitem.caf ---&gt; Lock folder (sounds so good)  
ThisAction... ---&gt; Plug folder

I tried putting the texting sounds in the keyboard but everytime you tap on a key the sound loops , i'm gonna have to cut up the sounds to make it better because it sounds horrid otherwise; so i recommend not putting that in.Sorry i haven't had time for that , i have a lot of other hobbies at the moment.

Now pick up your phone and go to settings , from there scroll down until you see SpringSounds , tap it and then go to Community's Sounds.; then select your sounds and then tap respring at the top.

After it turns back on PRESTO! your sounds should be working A-OK.

NOTE: you can make your computer have custom sounds too. I use max saying 'Wowser!' as my error sound and it's hilarious. I also have many other lines (go fuck yourselfie!) sounds as well; so if anyone wants them just pm me or reply saying so.

**HOLE TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE**

ok here comes the part i spent the longest time on , image editing isn't my forte and boy was this a pain in the fucking ass. Had to get my photoshop wizard friend on the case. But I digress... moving back to the plan , i used Jellylock7 from BigBoss , the repo link is

&gt;http://apt.thebigboss.org/repofiles/cydia

This should be there by default but if it isn't add it and install JellyLock7.  Now here comes the hard part , if you have an iphone 5/5s/5c you're in luck because i've already done it for you . The hard part is making the 'Hole to Another Universe' image not have a background (aka transparent) so that there isn't a big white background along with it on the lock screen. If you're one of the lucky few , here's the  [image you need](http://imgur.com/zUeKhB4). Now full disclosure , i have no idea how to do this with good quality in photoshop but other iphone users you can maybe take this image and change it's resolution to fit your screen ? or just try this idk. Experiment a bit and let me know so i can add it to the tutorial.

Now once you have the image , all we have to do is open up WinSCP and go to this path 

&gt;/Library/Application Support/JellyLock7/Contents/Resources.

Once here you should see something like [this](http://imgur.com/tSEXZ0y)

The key here is to replace the default jellylock handler with our image , the default is named 'jellylock_handler@2x' ; just rename our file to be the same as the default name for your device (it may be different from mine if you're not using a retina screen device) and then replace it in the folder.

After that just make sure jellylock7 is enabled in settings and then respring/reboot your phone and there you have it , it should be fine. For readers not using my phone type , try taking my image and changing its resolution to fit the screen , meaning if it looks too thin stretch it further with photoshop or paint or something (I'm really sorry i don't the specifics about this , i'm more of a programming dude than an art dude)

AD ADDENDUM: JellyLock7 on my OS version has this weird bug where if you try to use App shortcuts it crashes your phone and sends it into safe boot until you delete teh config file via ssh which causes app shortcuts to turn off.So i'd take care before messing with that option.

**THEMES**

Now we're at the really easy part, themes. So before we start , you should know that there are two major theme managers that i know of ; anemone and winterboard . i personally use anemone but you can use either and most themes should work with both of them. 

Now for the good stuff , for this [setup](http://imgur.com/lChDITR) i used 'Ayka' , but be warned that it costs $3.49 to get. You could pirate it/the ones below from a different source , but i'd prefer not to cover anything illegal in my tutorial.

Some really good themes that i think would work well with the LiS feel are these

* Fizz ( costs $2 from the follow repo ' http://cydia.zodttd.com/repo/cydia ' )

* Andora ( costs $2 from the same repo as above)

* Mel ($3 from http://apt.modmyi.com/ )

*Uni ($1.5 from zodttd)

* Jelly 1/2 (both of them are $2.5 from zodttd)

Sorry i couldn't find any good themes that felt fitting which didn't cost anything; unfortunately most good themes are monetized so you either shell out cash or pirate them. I'm unfortunately unable to help in either endeavor so you're on your own .

**MUSIC LOCK SCREEN**

So to get a screen like [This](http://imgur.com/m4ymYPY) ( the slider can appear over the album art btw you just need to tap it , i kinda forgot to do that in this photo so it looks weird.) , i used a tweak called 'Acapella' (no not the type of music) , unfortunately this costs $2 and available from the BigBoss repo which i've linked above . (For IOS 8.4+ users , you guys should get Acapella 2 instead of just Acapella)

**BATTERY**

To get the cute cartoony battery , i use a tweak called Alkaline . It's free and available from ModMyI.
There are other options than the battery i use so feel free to customize ; and if i was good at drawing i'd make a custom butterfly battery (HINT HINT GET ON IT ARTISTS).

**KEYBOARD**

To get the [lowercase keyboard letters](http://i.imgur.com/GRhIse7.jpg) to show there's a tweak called ShowCase available for free from BigBoss.

**CARRIER**

For replacing the carrier i used a pretty classic tweak which's been around for quite a while now , called Zeppelin , available from ModMyI for free. This nifty little tweak lets you change what you get instead of your carrier (mine is a tiny cloud) , There is a huge repository of already made carrier logos which you can check out ; i'm sure someone has made a butterfly one already . If you're diligent enough you could find the blue butterfly (or make it yourself if no one has).

**HOME SCREEN DESIGNS**

For the stylized icon arrangement as [so](http://imgur.com/0Q2Xx0K) , a tweak called HomescreenDesigner was used , it's available for $2 on BigBoss. The spiral type arrangement i'm using is available under the popularly used section on the app . just download it and apply if you want my home screen.

**EXTRA CUSTOMIZATION**

For some of the finishing touches to my little project , i stumbled onto a tweak called Springtomize 3. , available for $3 on the bigboss repo. I didn't change too much with this , Added an animation for when i switch pages on my phone called Time Machine (get it because max can time.. ah fuck it)
, Hide Background option under dock settings , Nested Folder option (to make folders inside folders), Hide Badges in Icons settings (so they don't overlap in my rather congested icon arrangement).

I also used a tweak called Mobius , which allows me to scroll between the pages of my home screen to my heart's content.(I love doing that when i'm standing in line and have nothing to do) It's available for free from 

&gt;http://repo.tylercasson.com/

OK... phew..... that was a lot more work than i expected. Thanks for taking the time to try this out , i hope you got the results you were expecting ; please comment your home screen so i can beam with pride at my mediocre teaching skills.This took me a whole lot of hours and was inspired by some redditor here sharing his own setup , which was super cool and i'll try to link if i can find it.
I don't usually mess with my phone , but unfortunately LiS sucker punched me hard enough in the feels to warrant an overhaul on my phone. If you guys have any questions , feel free to shoot them at me ; I'm here to offer support if you need it with anything. You got any questions or if you just wanna talk pm me or reply to the post and i'll be happy to oblige.

Through the game Mr. Jefferson got captured by the cops several times. What do you think he did or said when the cops found him? Did he try to escape, did he try to kill the cops or what?

On the the pictures where we see him with the cops he seems to be calm, like he accepts that he got busted and it's over.

What do you think?
/////////////////////
I broke up with my girlfriend a few days ago and well, I just finished it and now I'm a big emotional wreck. Honestly, I've never been struck so deeply by a game before and now I have this big gaping hole in my life. This was an amazing experience for me, but I feel so sad right now.
/////////////////////
(This happened months ago) So once I finally succeeded in getting my friend to play the game, he got back to me the next day and said he had refunded the game using the steam refund system (if one hasn't played a game for more than 2 hours, they are eligible for a refund). He told me that the game was boring and confusing. 

Naturally, that baffled me, so I commenced drilling him for info. He ended up telling me that he had played it for a few hours in which time he had done some stuff at the Academy followed by a kitchen scene where he had to look for and hide car keys "or something" - as he put it. 

"Wooow" - was my reaction. I explained to him why that was messed up, so he ran a quick file verification and found that over 600 of the game files were corrupted. He told me that he would pick it up later, "summer steam sale, for example". The wait is over. 

So, that happened...

I recently downloaded this game on steam and every single time i try and open it it crashes on the unreal engine screen and says fatal error. I have done everything everyone in the forums said to do but nothing works. Anyone know what to do?
/////////////////////
I sincerely hope i'm not the only one, but this game spoke to me on so very many levels. Some things i've dealt with personally, some ive watched others go through. Blew through the game in just over 24 hours calendar time since i started playing. God dammit Dontnot.
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
So I just started Episode 1 and for some reason as soon as I saw Mr Jefferson I recalled that he was like the villain or whatever, a killer. I know that it's one of the big twists in the series, and I'm worried that it's going to detract a lot from the game. Will it?

[Oxenfree](http://store.steampowered.com/app/388880/) , is not a whole lot like LiS but the teenage characters and decision making dialogue system resembles LiS greatly.

I think at $10 it's definitely worth checking out.

In my opinion the dialogue flows much better in oxenfree than in LiS, feels more natural to me somehow.  
The game is made by a studio founded by former telltale and disney employees , so they have a pedigree if you're looking for that.

Oh, look I'm actually later with this daily topic. I thought I was suppose to have these up at 12pm EST but now it seems to be up closer to 5pm EST. Whatever we all live in different time zones anyway so this is good for some and crappy for others.

These can be decisions that you didn't even choose in Life Is Strange. Like, I would never go to a diner for breakfast and not choose to eat bacon. Or I would never comfort some bitch who is mean to me and bullies the only pure thing in existence.

Hello folks!

So basically I'm currently re-building every map for a fan project just from screenshots of the map. It's a huge and annoying puzzle with thousands of models and textures.
But there's a way the game can load the different levels so there has to be a way the UnrealED can do that too right?

Usually Unreal uses .umap files, but I basically went through every single file structure in the game's source and I could not only find no .umap files, but nothing that even seems like it's some sort of a map or level file.

And ideas on this?

And please try to stay on topic and not drift to the "this is probably illegal side". It's just a personal experiment
/////////////////////
This game has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me. Suffering from depression and anxiety it was tough seeing Kate go through some of the stuff she did. Nobody understanding her. Lucky to have a friend like Max (If you did stand up for her...)  

This game is a masterpiece in its own right. And should be displayed for the world to see in a gallery. It was perfectly paced, kept you wanting more at the end of each episode and kept you on your feet.  

However  

Its got a huge flaw. Jefferson was incredibly predictable. I figured since he was always around in the biggest moments in the game and always made himself relevant, he would play a part in the murder of Rachel.
And as a final verdict... This game is a piece of art. It made me question my morals more times than Id care to admit. From letting Chloe steal the money to pay off her debt, Hating Nathan and David even though I knew they were probably not to blame for a bunch of the things that happened.  

And I cant even begin to start on this soundtrack. Phenominal! They hit every single note and without it this game wouldnt be Life is Strange.  

Thank you to the development team for stabbing me in the heart. And then continuing to stab me. This is real art. This is what gaming should be on a regular basis. It should make you feel sorry for the characters. It should make you question your actions, your decisions. This is life. Your decisions matter. If only I could reverse time...  

Now Im going to let me friend who has never played a video game in her life play. She has told me she is incapable of crying. I plan to let this game, this art prove her wrong
/////////////////////
Well, looks like I'm late past from what I said yesterday of putting this at at noon. Hey, it isn't my fault!!!! I went to sleep and stayed asleep until 3pm. Blame my comfortable bed for these issues.

Over the months I've found people to empathize with Nathan to a greater degree. Regardless, there are still a shit ton of things most can't forgive him for. Then there are those who simply don't give a damn and will hate him until the end of times. Explain why you hate Nathan or why he doesn't necessarily deserve the hate.
/////////////////////
I first experienced LiS through an LP, which was a lot of fun. Watching how someone else makes decisions and seeing how they react to dramatic parts of the story was very engaging. To anyone out there who enjoyed this game as a let's play as well, who did it the best in your opinion?
/////////////////////
I finished the game after playing it every chance I got over the past three days and I can now say it is one of my favorite games. I was inspired so I drew this picture of the reoccurring doe. Probably going to get a tattoo of it eventually.

/////////////////////
TL;DR: Loved the game, looking for something similar with a similar soundtrack and story.

I got the game yesterday morning (About 36 hours ago.) and almost 20 of those hours were spent playing the game, 10 were sleeping, and the rest were eating/taking quick breaks.

The point is, I loved this game. The gameplay was great and time travel really added to the story. The soundtrack was the best I'd ever heard by far. The graphics were pretty good, but the artistic design and the photography rules/techniques are what really appealed to me as a photographer. And finally, the story was so good. (I went with the Bae ending) The game ended up being really sad, but also a great reflection on life. This game is my new favorite game, and I need some games/movies to play/watch and fill the void while I wait the year or two for Life is Strange 2. I have some games that are similar, but does anyone have any recommendations for similar games on PC with a great story affected by your choices and a good soundtrack? I've tried Telltale Games such as TWD, but they were pretty boring for me.

/////////////////////
Since LIS is a very scenic game, I was wondering if the devs would implement support for the NVIDIA Ansel screenshot stuff. 
/////////////////////
I finally finished the last episode last night and I have a huge urge to jump back into the world. Is it worth playing it again or does it just get boring after a while because you already know the main story moments???

Message to Bears was one of the 'bands' I started listening to due to life is strange (their song 'mountains' is featured when Chloe and Max find zombie-rachel).

...I'm hooked! 

I picked it up on Steam because of the summer sale and now I'm going to grab the rest of the episodes before the sale ends. This looks like an awesome community and I want to thank you guys for marking spoilers so well around here!

A few thoughts on the first episode:
-I am loving that it tells me when an action has consequences no matter how trivial it may seem. Watering my plant? Consequences! Saving a bird from hitting a window? Consequences! It makes me second guess even the simplest of actions and I can't wait to see how everything plays out in future episodes. 

-I actually kind of feel really bad that I left Warren in the parking lot after Chloe picked me up rescuing me. He seems really nice and I wish I could have chosen to help him more! Lol

-I ultimately decided to stay hidden in the closet during the fight with Chloe and her stepdad but I also checked out what would happen if I stepped in. Chloe showed me the gun she took but then I decided to rewind and stay hidden, thus she didn't show me. Since I did this, does Max technically know she has the gun?

-I LOVED the fact that after the credits it shows what choices I made and what percentage of people picked each of them. Super cool feature that I wasn't expecting! That being said...

-Upon looking through those choices, I noticed a few things that I had missed. For example, I never even found Dana's pregnancy test so it marked that I didn't touch it, along with 98% of other players. So it makes me wonder how many of those 98% were like me and just didn't even see it while playing versus how many deliberately didn't touch it after finding it. Likewise, I DID tamper with David's files and purposely left them out in the open. But I wonder if many of the percentage of people who didn't tamper with the evidence just didn't discover it to begin with versus purposely covering it up. I know this feature is for fun and doesn't really matter at all but I thought it was interesting to note how it might not be a totally accurate reflection of people's choices. Does anyone have thoughts on this?

Anyway, I'm excited about joining this community and excited about starting episode 2 tonight!

/////////////////////
I finished Life Is Strange on Saturday - I'm still reeling from the entire experience and the sheer depth of emotion it stirred in me.  So many emotional highs and lows!  Before I say which ending I chose, I'll tell you why.

Even though I'm a British man aged 45 (so hardly target demographic), I still felt total empathy and every emotion with Max as she tried to do the best for the people she cared about.  I think both Chloe and Max grew up a lot in those last few days before the storm, with Max ultimately learning that she has to be prepared to accept and live with the consequences of her actions, and Chloe gradually losing her selfish and pessimistic streak, to the realisation that she can be a real hero saving the town and finding peace.

I don't really buy the Chloe &amp; Max girlfriends thing - for a start, Rachel was Chloe's "Angel" so for her suddenly to go "ok, she's dead.  Never mind I have Max now!" doesn't seem very plausible.  They do have a huge bond, but I think that's as far as it goes.  If you snoop in Victoria's room, Max says "Victoria is about as straight as me, but she really appreciates style", and Max is upset when she sees Warren with another girl.  I do think Chloe and Max love each other, but they won't risk their friendship by making more of it.  I also don't think Chloe would want to cause the death of other's loved ones - and her mum.  I'm not sure Max could live with the thought she'd caused the deaths of several of her school-friends and Arcadia Bay residents.

Warren I'm not sure about - early on I got the impression Max wasn't interested (or at least saw him as a good friend / brother), but later on she does flirt more so maybe there could be more to it.

So when it came down to it, Chloe argued that she should sacrifice herself to prevent the storm, and I had to watch in horror as she died... again.  I do think it was the right thing to do though as fate/destiny *really* wanted to fix the fact that Chloe wasn't dead over those few days!

I really, really wanted a "happy ending" option of going back to just before the shooting, saving Chloe, and shopping Jefferson and just maybe causing a bit of a snow flurry or a light breeze, but I kind of like how difficult the decision is - life isn't easy. :)

I immediately started a replay because I just felt like I wanted to experience Arcadia Bay some more - and I'm trying different options (but still saved Kate - couldn't let her die).  It's so well done and feels 'real' and 'lived in' - little touches like when Kate walks off crying from Jefferson, you can follow her along the corridor (she even tells you to leave her alone), and watch her go through the door out of the school.  In most games she'd just disappear, but you can watch her through the door go along the path and round the corner (in the direction of the dorms) - and all the traffic, people, animals that make it seem like a bustling place - little touches that make a difference.

But I'm still left with that feeling that I've a sense of loss, and regret for the pain my decisions caused Max (and Chloe).

The only games that made me feel anything like this, were The Last of Us and Journey - but the emotions from Life is Strange were so much deeper and stronger - I have no idea why, it just resonated with me.

I'm going through withdrawal and looking at buying t-shirts and listening to the OST (the soundtrack is amazing - so fantastically put together)...  But I really want more - I hope season 2 comes and has Max in again, but I know it most likely won't.

Hello everyone! Nice to see you in this thread :D


Okay so basically, as many others too, I'm not happy with the Bae (Saving Chloe) ending of the game.
It just feels unfinished and the developers even said so. In my opinion it's supposed to be a good ending with lots of positive energy behind it.
But all I can feel are questions and the unknown.

So I just had the idea for a big project being basically a short film (maybe only 30 secs up to 2 mins or so) changing the ending's atmosphere to what I feel it should be.


The very very rough concept is still in change but could be something like this:

As the original ending you see Chloe and Max drive out into the distance in the pickup. But the game doesn't end there.

I imagine the next scene featuring them somewhere relatively close by (maybe on a mountain road?) sitting on the back of the truck by the road watching the sunset/sunrise.
Chloe starts talking to Max "Max, have I ever told you how much I.." she get's interrupted by Max "Chloe.. don't". And finally Max kisses Chloe (baam! Pricefield).

Sitting there on the back of the truck you suddenly hear footsteps behind them, the camera still pointed away from the road, and Frank's voice. "You two dorks didn't really just leave without me did you?"
"Frank!"
(Max could even run to him and hug him now, we'd just have to be sure if he's that good with them already ;) )
"Hey C'mon girl! You're still freaking me out!"
"I'm just actually soo glad to see you"
(Chloe standing there by them kinda smiling at Frank (guilty smile &gt;:( ))

Here we'd have to figure out a way to end this one scene "softly" and move on to a long shot of the road in Arcadia Bay. And suddenly all these people are coming out of the houses and corners.
So many survived.


Basically something like this so that you get a rough idea of the concept I had in mind. That ending would still be.. yea Life is Strange, but an ending I can live with and can be happy with.



As some of you might have seen, I'm working as a hobby 3D artist. I would offer to take over the modelling, texturing and rendering for the scenes as well as the sound design.
I'm pretty sure we can sample all the spoken words easily from other parts of the games. Maybe not Frank's part, but we can figure something out for that.


What I am asking for now is all the help I can get with this project. It's big. Probably the biggest project I've ever worked on. But it's not impossible. I know we can pull this of.

I'm mostly looking for other 3D artist. Particulary animators, because I am really bad at animating anything. But every single person wanting to help is deeply appreciated!!!


And yes! I do know the other alternative ending someone made on youtube. It's well made, but there are some weird shots in there and it's not quite the story I wanted to tell and I have in mind. Not the right message.

I also want things to be bigger. Maybe even get voice actors if enough people support my idea


So, if you're interested, don't be shy ;)

Take the shot!


Peace out dorks ;)

So Dontnod has launched a brand new website. Looks really swell! But I did notice this...

http://dont-nod.com/en/studio/

Today DONTNOD is working on the action-RPG Vampyr ***and other as yet unannounced projects.***
/////////////////////
So yes, after I set myself in the mind of taking one week breaks between the episodes, I played 2-5 in 3 days xD
It was an amazing Journey. I've never had a Game mess with my emotions so much since Beyond Two Souls basically. And this was even worse (or better?)

And it's not just the game itself or the emotions it brought up. It had a big impact on my life in terms of how I look at certain things. And it might even got me a little first-hand help for improvement as a visual artist ;)
You all know what an amazing game it is and I don't have to point out every single upside of it since we're aware of that.


I do have a very few downpoints though.

To the technical side:

Please also keep all "it's a small indie developer, they didn't have the resources for it blah blah" out for one moment reddit and just let me look at this from a factual side :)

As much as they nailed the motion capture, the mimic of the characters was so bad, it was almost lowering the gameplay experience. How am I gonna say this.. I know the Unreal Engine is capable of complex face-rigs and I also know those face-rigs are actually in the characters of the game through some 3D work, the downside was the animation progress. Often the characters weren't able to show any visual emotion or anything at all, focused their eyes at a completely wrong spot not suitable for the scene (dead-eye effect) and so on. I'm a bit sad about that since we all know, at the latest since Half life 2, this is indeed possible in games, and it might would have made the already great experience even better.


Second technical thing is just a little thing actually, being the resolution of textures and models. Also a thing I definitely know isn't going to take too many resources as a developer to improve, but will definitely improve particulary close-up shots.


The last thing is the saving Chloe ending. It's the only ending I could do, I would do for my friends and that seemed logical. It's just sad to see how little effort went into that ending compared to sacrificing Chloe. They had the possibility to make that a truly positive and good ending without overdoing it, but chose to let us in ignorance, which is often worse than a bad ending.
And yes I did see the developers explaination for it being "magically enough" and them having not enough resources left as a tiny studio. But I still would have done it differently.


To turn this post back to a rave:

I'll probably spend the next months with doing fan-work all over.
 I'm also considering of actually getting Chloe's tattoo since all the different small pieces in it perfectly sum up what I had in mind "meaning-wise" for a tattoo anyway, and the experience with this amazingly hella great piece of visual art.


Thank you for reading so far 

I hope reddit will not take too hard on me :)

For a few months I would totally say I was over Life is Strange, not that it stopped being one of my favorite games anymore or anything but the post LiSD was gone and and I was content to move on.

Naturally of course it didn't last and here I am back to constantly thinking about Arcadia Bay and Max and Chloe again, maybe its time for another play through. Not entirely sure what triggered it but the itch came and then a listen to Obstacles on YouTube and now its back in full force.  

I will say I definitely re-realized just how much I love this community compared to other fandoms out there. It's sad to see it dwindling a bit but I suppose that is to be expected. 

Regardless, it would seem this damn game has grabbed hold of me again and I just wanted to engage with this awesome community once again.




/////////////////////
In almost every game we end up running into that character that we groan every time we have to interact with them. Hell, they could not even be a villain in the game. They could even be a perceived good person who we wish wasn't "our person". Which character from Life Is Strange annoyed you and why?
/////////////////////
I don't really understand how Max submitted a photo into the contest causes Jefferson to get caught. Can someone explain how that whole chain reaction works?
/////////////////////
With the context of the whole game when ever i hear any of the songs on the soundtrack on my mp3 player i stop dead in my tracks and have to think about life. The only things that have ever affected me as much as this game is the breakfast club (no idea why) and End of Evangelion.
/////////////////////
So, one of the best things about Life is Strange is the soundtrack both licensed and original. Never has music in a video game drawn so much emotion out of me whether it be sitting listening to the menu music or watching Max run to Chloe while "In my mind" plays. I can honestly say that the soundtrack to this game has completely changed my approach to both playing and composing music. The OST was particularly influential as I love the mix of environmental sounds with arranged instrumentation, I also love the feeling of nostalgia and calm that I feel when listening to it.

The use of classical guitar in the sound track really hit home for me and has subsequently made me re-evaluate my own approach to guitar playing, in that I realise that the guitar doesn't have to be overly technical to be poignant or emotive. Perhaps my favourite part of the OST is the sheer diversity of sounds within the arrangement and how they contribute to the overall texture. The pairing of acoustic instrumentation with synthesised sounds, to me is just astounding in that they both blend together with one another so perfectly which is not an easy thing to do. This and the sound track for "Akira" are two of the only ones that successfully achieve this in my opinion.

Now for the licensed soundtrack, I loved every choice as soon as I heard it, especially the use of Alt-J when Max was waking up, easily my favourite moment of episode 2. The soundtrack opened my eyes to new artists and such as bright eyes whom I've come to quite enjoy despite the fact I would never have listened to him before I played this game. I distinctly remember after playing for the first time actively searching for similar music, which to me says a lot about the choice of music by the developers. 

Anyway, thanks for reading I'd love to hear how the music affected everyone else who played it and if your a musician, did it effect your approach to music like it did mine?

TL;DR Soundtrack completely changed my outlook on music

Hey everyone, 

So im working on a video essay looking at relationships and romance in games. Im going to be looking at Dragon Age Inquisition, Fallout 4 and Life Is Strange. I want to get a general opinion on the romance/relationships in these games from the fans. I'd prefer to hear about your opinon of Pricefield, but if you have opinons on warren i'd love to hear them too. Id love to hear anything you have to say on the subject, but im also gonna provide some prompts that id love you do answer. 

* Playing through the game what are some of your favorite moments between Chloe and Max?  

* Do you think the game portrays gay relationships well? 

* How does Chloe and Max's relationship compare to other games/movies/books ect. you have have read/watched/played? 
 
* What is your biggest critique of the way their relationship plays out? 

Thank you for your time!

I couldn't save Kate.

I just finished ep 2, and now I feel awful. I tried, but she just... let go. And I couldn't rewind... I should have picked up the phone, but I didn't want chloe to fight with her mum, and everything just got out of control...

I thought it was a scripted event at first, but then the end screen showed that 100% of other people saved her... I don't know what I did wrong.

I hate this game. It's amazing, but I hate it right now.
/////////////////////
Just finished the game the other day. One of the best games i have played. Have you guys noticed the photographic scenes in the game..for example when max tends to sit..and space out..the shots are very amazing..if only three is photo mode in the game..and the use of music..right in the feels
/////////////////////
When we had to unlock Nathan's phone in EP4, we can use the PIN code or the PUK, and apparently in EP5 [if you fail the code 50 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4pynjo/ep5_spoilers_turns_out_if_you_are_bad_enough_at/) you can still come out from the bathroom of the dinner (there is also the suggestion about the mirror given after 5 attempts)

So I was wondering if there was a second way to enter into the Dark Room. 

I knew that the code was the one marked in red but I didn't remember it. Fortunately I had photographed all the Nathan numbers when I had to unlock his phone (so I could try them without closing the phone every time) and when I arrived at the door of the Dark Room I still had the photo. 

So the question is: if someone doesn't remember the code, there is a second way to get it? Just curious since I have already finished this fantastic game

Edit: there is also the David padlock. The code was in EP3 but if you don't remember it, you can break the lock.
/////////////////////
I've read a lot of theories on LIS since the first episode came out. Probably, one of the more extreme ones was that Frank was actually a undercover cop that ended up a actually drug dealer. Most of the people in the police force know he is a undercover and that is why the principal doesn't really follow through on David's information.They don't know he is now Rogue and that is why he never really gets in trouble with the cops. Another part was that when he was actually undercover he got to close with Rachel. Because Rachel actually used drugs he ended up using some of what he was selling. After she went missing he thought she left him because of him going crazy one day after using whatever drug he was selling. The theory involved some stuff like that and ends up somewhere else. What was a crazy theory you've read?
/////////////////////
I played one of the best games in recent years, and the majority of those roughly 17 hours I spent watching the
screen without doing anything. For me, this game came in a time in which I rarely finished any games. Just a few months before,
I wasn't playing anything at all. For some reason, I wasn't able to get into any games, I simply didn't feel it. Maybe
I had grown out of videogames, maybe I had gotten too old to enjoy such a simple pleasure. But that couldn't be it, I knew better than
that. While they often are nothing but simple pleasures, I've loved games with a passion that some developers manifested
in brilliant and complex, often mindblowingly good games. Forcing myself to play was not a viable option, so I merely
accepted my lack of joy. It wasn't limited to games at the time, so maybe I would get it back at some point. And boy,
did I. Getting back into gaming started with the lowest form of it, the simple pleasures. Competetive online games and
an Action-RPG here and there, but nothing I played passionately, nothing I could actually dwelve into for hours on end.
A few months of this passed until I randomly grabbed Life Is Strange on a Steam Sale. I had heard it was supposed to be
crazy good. But I had also heard it was emotionally gripping and possibly heartbreaking. The idea felt a bit too close to life, and even
in life itself I wasn't having any intense emotional reactions at the time, so I procrastinated playing it like I procrastinated
doing everything else that might differ from my day to day numbness and repetition. Another reason was my awareness of how
susceptible I am to emotionality, to likeable characters and to the atmospheric escapism I was expecting from this game and had experienced
in other games, films and shows.
After three more months I finally decided to start it up. Ready to get blown away and to be emotionally petrified I wanted
to give it a try. The first few minutes of the game triggered only my need for escapism, my joy of fleeing into the
beautiful atmosphere the game presented me with. The characters didn't seem too interesting, yet. But it wasn't long
until I felt it, this strange boredom, this inability to concentrate and enjoy fully. I turned it off. 
The day after that I decided that this couldn't be it. Would I really have to miss out on this experience because I
couldn't bring myself to keep playing for even an hour? Not this time. I felt ready and I started it up again.
It turns out that this was all I needed. All this game needed to nail me down was about one hour of playtime.
And then it consumed me, it made me wish I would never have to leave Arcadia Bay and its beautiful locations, its romantic
take on human emotions, its light and clever humour, its often dark and amazingly mysterious stories, its dreamy
atmosphere, and above all its gloriously colorful characters, all much more interesting than their nonfictional equivalents.

Each episode ending gave me that satisfying, yet hauntingly painful feeling that games only rarely deliver, a feeling I
almost exclusively know from the most intense films I have watched. The further I progressed, the more I was interested in
how it would all play out. It had been a while since I could feel suspense and anticipation that direct and strong. But all of that
went hand in hand with the fear of a painful crash resulting from a combination of Maxes' story ending and my emotional high
dropping hard. Trying to blend out this fear, I enjoyed every single goddamn minute of it. I had almost never played a game of 
this genre, or any genre for that matter, that made me actively look at every possible piece of lore, information or storytelling.
I felt an inexplicable desire to hear what Max had to say about every single person and every single object. If a button could
be pressed, I didn't hesitate to press it, not even once. The voice acting was superb, especially that of Max and Chloe, and
the characters and the world as a whole felt all too real. 

What really completed the game, what truly tied it all together, was the music. If it was the jukebox in the Two Whales, 
the stereo in Chloes' or Maxes' room, or if it was simply a cutscene with a song, every piece of it fit perfectly. If an
emotion was not invoked already anyway, the right song, and all of them were right, not only invoked that emotion, it lifted it
to a level that games only do on very, very rare occasions. 

Life Is Strange embodies the idea that games can be art, that games can transport philosophical messages, that games can make you weep and cry, make you laugh, and that games can actually create an accurate yet abstract image of life itself. The only problem is the vortex it creates, sucking you into this image and leading you to missing it dearly when facing reality. In melancholic, emotional, generally unhappy and often lonely people like me (not exclusively of course), this creates an inexplicable pain that only slowly fades away with the games' memories, like that of a lost love, while still leaving a permanent mark.

Hello all,

I'm Kirk from the http://lifeisstrangefans.com/

I've been been writing in a journal inspired from Max's in the game.

It's not the most artistic thing ever nor is my blog the best written piece of work on the internet.

They're my feelings though and this game has led me to finally express them thanks to it's message.

I've finally reached a point where emotionally I'm ready to open myself up to random people on the internet.

Hey guys!!

So, I have played almost through the second episode of Life is Strange. I love it!! I've decided to get back into streaming a bit more, and for my website, I have decided to do a bit of a 'series.' My plan is to write about LGBT themes in popular video games, highlight a certain game, and then stream that game.

I'm going to start with Life Is Strange. I've found a few articles and stuff about it, but I'm wondering if any of you have any input about it, or know of any articles/blogs that have written about it. Any help would be much appreciated :) Thanks!!
/////////////////////
Just finished episode 1 and it felt like some weird SciFi episode of 'The OC' and I'm okay with that.
/////////////////////
FINALLY just finished this game, and I'm incredibly grateful to the community for being so diligent in tagging spoilers. You're all fantastic!  
I feel the need to thank you all since three HOURS after the new season of Orange Is The New Black went up on Netflix, people were posting maybe the biggest spoiler of the season as comments on instagram photos. Thank you guys for not feeling the need to do that.
/////////////////////
I just finished the game, and all I can say is.. wow. A game has never made me feel like this before, I just became so attached to Max and Chloe as a team that I couldn't give her up at the end. Definitely had to be my most favourite game ever played.

Am I naive in thinking I'll find any other game that is any bit similar to this and will provoke the same reaction? Anyone have any recommendations for any game similar to this? 
/////////////////////

I'm pretty sure by now we all have a character that we either always hates, loves, or just didn't really care about.Which character from Life Is Strange will you opinion never sway on and why?
/////////////////////
Hi, I was wondering since Max is very shy in the beginning of the game and she wasn't already friend with Warren like she was with Chloe how did they connect in the first place, like how did they first hang out? Is there any reference I missed or it's left to us to decide?
/////////////////////
So only after 3 days, I have decided to do a second play through of LiS because I want to listen to all the dialogues that i missed.


Not sure if this has been discussed before or not, but what if Max have contacted Chloe when she went back to Arcadia Bay? Do you think this will prevent the Nathan shooting incident? 


I think that maybe Chloe will talk to Max first before she blackmail Nathan, and maybe Max will talk her out of it.


What do you guys think? 


Edit: Just to clarify, i'm talking about pre time-powered Max.
/////////////////////
Only thing I've found is redbubble.

Does anyone have the song that plays when Max picks up a item? I don't know how to rip sound audio from games, so if you know how to I will be forever grateful.
/////////////////////
Hi everyone. With the sales up on steam, I've been thinking about trying the game. However, I has already watched a lets play of it up to episode 4. So would it really be worth for me to play it from scratch at this point?
/////////////////////
I just finished the game and
HOLY
SHIT!
How am I supposed to live with myself now? I feel like I'm in some kind of a depression. I've never cried over a game before but this time I drowned the street.
The ending was the thing that made me hate the game but it also adds to the things that make the game good.
I can't listen to the soundtrack without crying now...
So let me go over it quickly:
time traveling sucks.
So you save your best friend that's been alone for so long and in depression. You two meet again and have awesome fun, even have some kissy time.
She dies over and over again, you save her over and over again to the f*cking point where a mountain sized tornado destroys the city while you two are watching.
And then suddenly you have to go back in time and let your friend die right next to you, after all the sh*t you went through, saving her dad, making her an imbecile, saving her from a train, bullet and whatnot and in the end a bullet still kills her and you have to sit there and watch in order not to alter time...
And now, all the CRAZY and fcking AWESOME sht you just went through is just the memory of a dream. No one will ever know, even Chloe won't and all she knows before getting shot and dying painfully is that everyone betrayed her. Damn, she doesn't even know that her best friend... best friend from the childhood now* is back in town and saved her so many times, I mean
WHAT
THE
F*CK?!
And there is the other ending where you save Chloe but sacrifice THE WHOLE TOWN.
And it just ends like that... It's pointless without season 2 and there probably won't be one.
This was such a bad ending that it's actually good. I'm confused, I don't know what to do with my life after this, what the fuck man.

Sorry for the upcoming wall of text.

I've been waiting for this game since it was announced. I was a fan of Remember Me, and trusted Dontnod that it would be a quirky and enjoyable experience. I hate episodic releases as they usually make us wait way too long in between releases, so I waited until the full game was out. Didn't get a chance to purchase the game until last week, and..I don't know if it was worth the wait.

Episode 1 didn't make the best impression on me, but I was still interested. As I went through the episodes, usually one per night, I got more and more invested into the characters and world. They (the main characters, not those like Alyssa, Juliet, etc.) all feel like real people. Hannah Telle and Ashly Burch did phenominal jobs at lending their voices; they really made the characters come to life.

I didn't realize how deep in I was until episode 4. I had an idea that Rachel was dead but actually finding her and seeing Chloe (I'm a total Pricefield shipper) cry, it was tough. Really tough. Then seeing her get shot by Mark Jefferson? Absolute heartache. This all culminated with the final episode where the Bae ending made me feel really..hollow. It was clear the budget wasn't really there but I felt it was satisfying enough. I made the mistake of seeing the Bay ending, and my God it was completely heart wrenching. Seeing those "real memories" as photos burn and the new memories take over..ouch.

I don't know where I'm going with this. This game has made me feel like no other game has before..I recently found out about the term post game depression, and that describes this to a T. Fuck, for the first day or two I was really bummed. I probably actually seemed depressed to people that don't see me too much. It hurt so much that I almost regretted buying the game. I've been watching some of my favorite Youtubers, Jesse Cox and Dodger, play the game and it's slowly helping me cope.
As I'm typing this, I think there's a beauty in something that can evoke such emotion and raw feeling from me. Thanks, Dontnod. How long have you guys been dealing with post game depression? What do you do to help it?

TL;DR: Played game, am sad. Very sad. Must be a beautiful piece of art if it can evoke such raw emotion from myself and others. What do you guys to help the post game depression?
/////////////////////
Simple question. Do you think that Dontnod should refine what they have, or take a step in a different direction?

I always thought rural Appalachia would be interesting. Kentucky or Tennessee, or maybe West Virginia. Colonial and neocolonial architecture, homesteads, old coal mines, rivers and lakes and trees, a vague sense of preservation of a time-gone-by... and modern social difficulties, of course.
/////////////////////
I know that a good majority found out about this game because the loved the games that TTG put out. Now, opinions on Telltales style can vary greatly. I for one thought that one big aspect was the ability to actually explore to some degree. You could virtually look and interact with most objects. There are others but what do you think made Life Is Strange different?
/////////////////////
This game did a number to me and I would like the pleasure to share this experience for someone who doesn't own the game.

The game is currently on sale until July 4th and I can afford to gift two copies via email until then. Please nominate yourself or a friend who does not own a copy of the game that you know will cry tears of joy and sorrow. I will gift a copy to the first two nominations I receive in this post. I encourage others to share the love for the responses I receive after the first two nominations.

Love you guys!

/////////////////////
There are a lot of things that people have and are saying about LIS that does rub me the wrong way. Though, the one that really bothers me is when people say they hate it because you play as a girl. I've even read comments and reviews that say the game is good but can't recommend it because of the female protagonist. What are some things you that rubs you the wrong way?

/////////////////////
Wow, I have to say, this ending was amazing with Max forced into horrible choices. I ended up choosing to save Chloe and now I just need to talk about it because I've just been sitting here thinking how beautiful it was that the same song played as what had happened in Ep 1 giving the saga a Book Ends feel.
As someone who really liked the Refuse ending in ME3 and the ending of The Last of Us, I guess saving Chloe was the obvious choice so I was a bit surprised at the near 50/50 split. My reasoning was that if Max lets Chloe die, there's a 100% chance that Chloe is dead (well duh) but there's not a guarantee that the storm wouldn't come anyways. From a meta standpoint, sure we know sacrificing Chloe can't have the consequence of still causing the storm (otherwise it'd just be the wrong choice) but Max can't know that in here situation. Plus I didn't feel like present Chloe had the right to decide the fate of past Chloe as they're basically two different people. By the same logic that nightmare!Max isn't the same person as the Max we play as, denying past Chloe the chance to grow as a person isn't a call for Max or Chloe to make (stupid time travelling). I chose to euthanize disabled Chloe and probably would have respected her wishes to save the town if she would just drop dead there but not by killing her at her lowest point thinking everyone abandoned her.
On the other hand, a lot of people died in defying fate, most who didn't deserve it but if you had to push an innocent person in front of a train to stop it from killing more people, can't really be faulted for not doing it right? Really I'm only making this post because I don't really know what is the "right" choice and am trying to justify it to myself (I guess Max would also have to after both endings). I would love to read other people's thoughts on this.
/////////////////////
Not plot holes like "WTF that shit does not fit". I mean writing holes that can set things up and have it mostly work for a "Season 2" with Max &amp; Chloe.

I'm not trying to start the Pricefield Fan Wars here, I'm sure theres been that in the past. If you didn't chose Chloe, or didn't really care for her ^you ^weirdos ^;) that is totally fine!

Seriously, so plz put away the flamethrowers and think about this from a writer's perspective.

The more I replay the story I keep seeing new interesting bits that I missed the first few times. Then started thinking about a Season 2 with Max &amp; Chloe.

Now I always play the Bae ending personally, but I've seen the ending cinematic for the Bay ending so I'm pretty familiar with it. Since there are 2 different endings I wonder how could they move forward with Max &amp; Chloe together. No prequel crap either, I hate that shit.

Another season with them could begin a new arc, carrying forward their maturity and lessons learned. Max has shed a lot of her innocence and is becoming more familiar and responsible with her powers. Chloe beginning to be a true "bad ass" because she is finally accepting things about herself and life. She always had the 'tude, she needed the maturity to temper and shape it. I think it would be an amazing thing to explore.

*"No no no, Chloe DIED in one choice."*

Did she?

Whether intentional or not, Christian and Dontnod left themselves a couple holes, know where?

**Hole #1** (Could work, but a little clunky)

When do they ever show Chloe definitively DEAD in the end cinematic? Sure there was a lot of blood on the bathroom floor, but David was near the bathroom at that time, he at least has basic medical training from the military. The gunshot would have been heard VERY well in the school so responders and medical services would have been called quickly.

At the funeral, the casket is closed. So who's in there? Could be Chloe sure, could also be Rachel. Everyone there at that funeral scene knew or hung out with Rachel.

*"Yeah, ok, so then where's Chloe, she'd totally be at Rachel's funeral."*

Yeah she would, unless she got SHOT in the abdomen. Wounds like that are rarely instantly fatal but will lay your ass up for a little while ;)

So depending on how close the funeral was to when Chloe was shot, she wouldn't be able to attend.

*"Yeah, but there is that tombstone and where are Rachel's parents."*

True there is the tombstone but it's brief in the cinematic, in the background and blurry enough that the name is hard to make out. Also true we don't see Rachel's parents. Maybe they're off camera. More plausible would be, like Chloe said early in the story, they are still in denial and simply didn't attend. Not everyone handles tragedy well and some flat out refuse to believe it.

Like I said, a little clunky but it could work.

Even if we say that Chloe did die, there is yet another moment, during the ending Bay cinematic. Which brings me to:

**Hole #2** (I like this one better)

When the photos are burning and being swapped showing the timeline changes, there is one that solidifies and made me pause.

We see Max sitting in her room on the floor with a bunch of pictures carefully arranged around her in some kind of organized groupings.

She is holding one right up to her face, staring very closely and intently at it. Kind of odd.

What is one of Max's powers again? Could be a good place for a photo jump.

When the devs are asked about them returning, they don't really come out and say "No.". They step around that topic by saying that their character arcs are over and their coming of age story is told, etc.

Even if they would come out and say no, they can always change their minds. And really, when you look at the overall story mechanic, time travel, etc. they could work just about whatever they wanted in.

So, what do you guys think? Have any ideas of your own that work into the story context?
/////////////////////
would love if the makers made another one or another game like this
/////////////////////
I honestly lost it when I saw Chloe in that wheelchair. I just started balling. I needed about a day or two until I could go back to the game. Even during the scene where they were walking along the beach and Max was pushing Chloe, God. I just couldn't see Chloe like that. I have never been so moved/cared about a video game character until I came across LiS. I absolutely love this game. So did you break down, if so when?
/////////////////////
I got the limited edition today and immediately put the disc into the PC to import the tracks into iTunes. I made a playlist for it and when I synced the ipod it wouldn't transfer the playlist. :( I kept trying and trying, eventually it would add the playlist but empty, then I got it to add the first song to all of you. I've done this before adding songs to playlists from discs and syncing to the iPod. Has anyone else tried this or been able to do it?
/////////////////////
Did anyone here attend?  My guess is that if you did, you were required to agree to an NDA so I'm not going to ask about what they asked.

But what were your "feelings" about the experience?  Were you excited? Bummed? Give us something!
/////////////////////
Hi, I'm a 18 years old boy from Italy. I finished Life is Strange two days ago and I have to say I didn't feel so depressed for detaching from a story in a very long time. Needless to say I loved it with all my heart. But while and after playing and after processing my feelings about the game I came to the conclusion that maybe this time it feels so weird to be done with it because it kind of changed my view on life. I read many posts like this while searching about the game and it feels good to know I'm not the only one, so I'm sorry if it feels redundant but I chose to write this to get it out of my sistem and also hear back from fans.
There are millions of things that got me thinking while playing the game, the whole multiverse thing made me think how actually short our stay in the world is and how it's important only because we are rational beings with a spark of emotion inside ourselves that makes life worth it against all the odds.
Another thing is that I have few close friends and I tend to not like people because I feel different from most of them. LiS made me think of the big mistake I make when I think of people as a whole just because they look alike, and dress alike, and I don't. Even what I wrote before - most of people, what does that even mean? I think I've been doing their same mistake even though I thought I was smarter. Maybe the moment I identifed the most with Max is when in Episode 4 she's sitting at the Vortex party and she hates everything that's going on around her, yet she thinks "I hate feeling like this. Angry and depressed". And as soon as she said that I felt like it was my whole view on life captured in that moment. I'm sick of all the 'misfit' feelings and the social awkwardness, I wish I could just like everybody. And it's clearly my fault because I felt so superior in being different that I've being putting people in categories my whole teenage life.
And the atmosphere, it felt good because I'm such a dork and I enjoy looking at the sky when it's near dark and it's scarlet and stuff like that. By the way is Oregon really that beautiful?
Ultimately it made me think that there's more to life than what I'm experiencing and that I once knew that but then I did my best to find my identity and I settled on the one that social convention gave me - since I feel different I have to be different. So stop looking for connections excetera excetera
I am really confused because I don't want to give up on making myself a better person but I don't know what to do. I feel like I should be starting back when I was 14.
I'll try anyway. I'll do my best. I will also start to follow the paths I wanted but never did. I really like physics but I still got one year of highschool so I've always pushed it forwards. And other things I like to do like photography and art. And I'll try to just be better with people.

Ok I'm done, sorry for all the teenage bullshit, I know. Any kind of comment is appreciated, if you want to insult me go ahead

Also, thank you DONTNOD. Really. It's been a weird year so far and I've changed a lot - LiS made me want to keep trying
/////////////////////
For me personally playing any game has me wanting to know all the things. Especially, if I'm chin deep invested into whatever is happening. So its interesting to me seeing a lot of players choosing to skip talking to numerous characters....at least for their first playthrough. Did you actually talk to everyone?
/////////////////////
I wanna read some.

one cross I read was [Life Is Normal](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-is-normal-post-gm-worm-life-is-strange.23747/page-1) (Worm + LiS)

Thank you!
/////////////////////
Do you guys think they're gonna continue Max's story or bring in a new protagonist? 
I'm asking this because the 2 endings of season 1 were totally different and I'm not sure how the story would continue.
/////////////////////
Is that no matter which ending you choose, Max will forever live with the memories of what Jefferson did to her. It makes me sad that I couldn't protect my little Maxie. :( Fuck Mark Jeffershit.

The one that plays whenever you have Max sit down somewhere is different than the ending credits theme. Same song, but sitting down is softer and uses an electric piano or organ, whereas the ending credits uses guitar.

Ive looked all over YouTube to find that piano version. I know its in the game files of course. Has anyone found it online to listen to? Or can someone get it out of the game and upload it, please?

Thanks! :)

Most of us that have played or heard of Life Is Strange. Have watched one or two let's plays as a way to see how others fair. Personally, I've found it harder to revisit LIS(the feels) but still love to actively participate here and other places. I

Hey everyone! 
As the title says, I'm looking for 4K (even 8K) version of the concept art.
I've only found these two so far: 
http://imgur.com/a/XwpuN
Does any of you have some of them laying in their super secret folder and doesn't mind sharing? :)
Thanks in advance! 
/////////////////////
So here's a little something I did today. You've all probably seen content like this already, but eh, here's one more to the pile.

[Clicky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJL9-bYMQpA)

I quite liked the songs in the game, and this song is probably my favourite. Now, I'm usually more of a hard rock/heavy metal kinda guy, but, uh, you know, doesn't mean I can't like this type of music as well :)

And hey, if you guys and gals have any suggestions for me for further listening (besides the game's soundtrack), I'm more than happy to hear 'em.

On that note (haw haw haw), I've got a few suggestions of my own for you:

[Late Goodbye - Poets of the Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzsiE44Lz_w)

[Carnival of Rust - Poets of the Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKk1u5RMTn4)

[Roses - Poets of the Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KS2b1eSWUdo)

And for something a bit more heavier:

[The Outlaw Torn - Metallica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoQHRyh03_8)

I dunno, I thought the Metallica song fit the game at least somewhat lyrics-wise.

Cheers o7
/////////////////////
So like many people here, I played through the game and was absoultly moved, and cried while playing for the first time while playing a video game. Something I really like are quotes, and how they can really change a character or situation. But looking back on the entire story, I kinda noticed that their aren't many huge deep quotes! So I was wondering, if people could post their favorite quote and why? Would love to see what moves you guys :)
/////////////////////
Okay, so I know this isn't usually the subreddit where people would post about this stuff, and if it isn't alright for me to post it here, I apologize, but I thought out of all people, you guys might be my best bet.

Anyway, so I've been reading quite a few fanfiction, and I found out that I'm really enjoying the ones where Max's character is altered in some way. Maybe not completely, but just to make it a but AU. So, what I'm looking for is Max(es?) who abuse her timepowers for their own sinister purposes :D It can get as dark as you want it to, I don't care. I would just like to read about a Max that utilizes the whole range of possibilities of her powers.

Thanks in advance, and I'm sorry again if this post isn't appropriate to post here.

I bought the game when it was released. After an episode I had to wait till the next episode is out. After episode 2 I stopped playing because I want to wait till all episodes are out. 
Last week a friend of mine started playing LIS and asked me if I know the game. So we talked about it. I remembered that I started this game more than 1 year ago but forgot to play the new episodes. 
This weekend I started playing again from Episode 1 and play till the end without a break. 
So I finished LIS yesterday, and wow..what an emotional and awesome game.
Post-Game Depression is real.
/////////////////////
It's been a really long time since LIS initially released and we were introduced to this wonderful phrase. From what I remember there were some mixed feelings. As the episodes went on the amount of hella's we got reduced to some degree and I remember fans wanting more.

How did you feel about Chloe saying "Hella" and did it change over time?
/////////////////////
I played through the game around 6 months ago and i tried to get over the emotional hangover of sorts that i got. I couldnt, so i pushed it away at the back of my mind trying to forget about it. But after finishing The Last of Us, another very emotional game, i knew i had to come "pay my respects" to the characters and feelings i had when i first played through this game. When i completed the game initially, i just turned it off and went to bed.  Just the typical post game sickess everybody gets. But returning back to the game today, listening to the music, watching the cutscenes online  All the feelings i felt 6 months ago just finally hit me and i started sobbing. I tried to play the game again today but turned it off right as i reached the bathroom door. I felt as if playing through the game a second time would be "disrespectful" to my first run. Can anybody relate? Ive been playing the photography classroom scene for at least an hour straight over and over again. Help me.
/////////////////////
I don't want this to be a soppy story, more of a kudos to the ability of a game as art to reach into me and actually make changes.   
  
My dad killed himself when I was 16, a year after my brother did, and I have gone through a similar "rebellion against everything" that Chloe did. He did it the day after Father's Day so it's always a rough time for me.  
When it's deeply rooted, it stays with you for life.  
However when you're in the middle of it, it's hard to see how you're letting these old things affect your every day life and choices.  
  
Seeing how Chloe was mad, and sometimes irrational due to that loss made me realize that I had acted in similar ways through my life without realizing it.  
I feel like the hardest part of fixing something about yourself is identifying it, and this game has literally made me deal with issues I've suppressed for years.  
  
There's a certain catharsis in realizing these things, and I have this game to thank for tackling tough, real issues that people can identify with.  
  
Guess that's my rant over, just felt like saying thanks after playing LiS got me through Father's Day  
  
Thank you, DONTNOD

Like the title says I want to give this fanfic a try but the thing is I haven't wrote a fanfic before. I have some ideas for my fanfic but I need some tips on how to get started. To tell you the truth I been wanting to do this since November of last year but I was in a pretty depressed state after finishing the game. I mean it's not that am scared of people not liking it or anything it's probably due to the fact that I will be putting myself out there which is pretty fucking scary when you think about it. So if you guys have some tips it will be greatly appreciated.

Allo friends!

A few months ago, I made a post about my fanfiction Ouroboros. I had just finished the 8th chapter and it was around then that I started really thinking that I could just keep going and hopefully along the way, people might read it and enjoy it.

And here we are - I just posted my 30th chapter! This is by far the longest thing I've ever written and I've been so stupidly fortunate with positive feedback. So, for the half of this post that ISN'T shame(ful)less advertisement, I want to thank any of you who may be going along with me on this adventure. Your support means so much to me and I love you all!

Onto the other half - I admittedly feel a little weird trying to promote the story, but since it has been a few months since my last post, I figured I'd give it a shot for all the newcomers who may not have heard of it but are interested in the fanfiction available for the game. 

So, what's the story about? At the cliff, when Chloe convinces Max to sacrifice her, something weird happens with the photo hop which ultimately allows the two to actually have a life together! It's Pricefield 1000000%, and as I have said in a recent Author's Note, that's really the best way I can describe the story. I try to incorporate a lot into the story, so you can expect a lot of romantic fluff, goofy shenanigans with the other characters, time travel mystery and even some NSFW content with Max and Chloe. It's really just a story about them after the events of the game and all the stuff that entails. If that sounds like it might be your kind of thing, then please give it a look!

I'm relatively new to this sub-reddit, so I'm not sure how much discussion there has been of details and analysis of different characters, but I'm on my second play through and I'm noticing a whole bunch of things. For example - all the cars David was tracking are in the parking lot. (Anyone have a theory who the other red truck belongs to? How about who "Ms. Fancycar" is? I assume it's probably Victoria, but it could also be Ms Grant or maybe another student...)

One of the main things I noticed that got me thinking is when Chloe is talking to Max about Rachel the first time we're up in her bedroom, and she says, "Just before she went missing, she was talking about meeting someone who changed her life..." I sort of remembered this quote, and I think I assumed it was Frank she was talking about. However, I realize that Rachel and Frank had been on/off for months, so Frank couldn't possibly be the person she was talking about. I guess the other person would be Jefferson (or maybe Nathan?) who probably attracted her by telling her she was his muse and asking her to model for him *shudder*. However, we all know what modeling actually meant...

This makes me wonder how many of the photographs actually *could* have been consensual... I wonder if Rachel agreed to be drugged with the hopes it would start her modeling career... It just makes it all so much sadder!

So what do y'all think? Is Jefferson the person who "changed her life?" Were some of the photos in the bunker consensual? 
/////////////////////
I recently played Life is Strange for the second time and I thought it was interesting how my emotional journey differed this time around. I was curious how other people's second playthroughs went.

So my first playthrough involved powering through all five episodes over a weekend. It was en emotional roller coaster that ended in me feeling depressed for a week. It was a while before I could even listen to the soundtrack without my chest feeling a bit tight.

Enter a week or so ago when I fired up the game. I heard the title music without getting emotional. Good start. Got through the first episode thinking things will be much easier this time round (although the first episode is pretty cruisy). But at the end of the first episode when the snow starts falling and the music starts playing I found myself getting all emotional and realising things wouldn't be as easy as I thought.

After that I started feeling a bit melancholy, almost like I was pre-emptively getting depressed over the game ending. This time I played the game over four days and found myself frequently thinking about it and feeling sad while I wasn't playing it.

The weird thing though, was that when it was over rather than feeling depressed I kind of felt relieved. Like I'd worked through all my feelings during the playthrough. I even picked the bay ending this time (which I consider to be the sadder of the two endings) and didn't even shed any tears. Not to say there were no tears shed at all during the game. The part where they find Rachel's body consistently makes me well up (which I can confirm after watching several let's players' reactions and getting teary eyed every time).

It's been about two days since I finished it and I've had a few moments of sadness here and there for the most part I'm feeling all right. Although I still feel like I need to avoid the soundtrack for a while.
/////////////////////
Do you think Life is Strange was inspired by the Anime "The Girl who Leapt through Time' which came out in 2006.(which is kind of a sequel to a life action movie a decade earlier.)

From the IMDB discription:
"A high-school girl named Makoto acquires the power to travel back in time, and decides to use it for her own personal benefits. Little does she know that she is affecting the lives of others just as much as she is her own."

It's been a few years since I watched the film, but I enjoyed it and that's why I wanted to play Life is Strange.  While TGWLTT was more uplifting, I finally got around to playing LIS and just finished the game after starting it two days ago.  I enjoyed Life is Strange for how it got darker with each episode.   And you have to give props for a mainstream video game for them dropping the 'C bomb' in episode 5.  The ending for LIS was predictable but the appropriate one for the storyline.  We grew to care about some unknown girl who who was shot in a drug deal gone bad in the beginning to by the end, to see what a tragedy it was, etc.  Yeah I picked the sacrifice Chloe ending.

But about the anime movie and this game, I think the similarities are that they are both likable high school seniors and basically have rewind powers, and there is one key event that they keep going back to.  I think they borrowed that concept but the dark plot in LIS is inspired by other movies and books.  I'd say Twin Peaks for the Northwest scenery and the missing Rachel angle.  I haven't seen The Butterfly effect, but that's been mentioned.  The Cosby Show and Inspector Gadget may have been another, jk.

So yeah, a bit of explaining ahead.
I only played the first episode so far (others are still on the way from UK :/) and I already deeply fell in love with the game and it's characters (try not to accidentally post spoilers in the comments please ;) )

It was super super fun working on these pieces and I plan on doing much more Life Is Strange Art in the future. So if you have suggestions, ideas or requests, just throw them at me :D

/////////////////////
Ok so I've been meaning to ask this for a while. 
So you know in Episode 5 when you talk to Jefferson in the dark room?
At some point he talks about Rachel, and it's weird because he talks like Rachel actually liked having pictures being taken of her. That's what he says. And if you talk to Stella in episode 1 just when you get outside the building she says that Rachel had some type of relationship with him. 
This just confuses me. Are there theories on this stuff? Or was Mark just delusional? Not that I actually would care what a psycho like him thinks, but I'm interested because I've never seen anyone talk about it or have theories or anything...

/////////////////////
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavS9FgMyzg (btw i was bored)

/////////////////////
Hotdog Man is probably my favorite character introduced in this game.
/////////////////////
Many of us connected with Life Is Strange because of the characters and the familiar school life that we can't believe is actually real. Some of us are like Max in that we can do so much better if we apply ourselves and believe in our abilities. Some of us are like Chloe in that we literally fucked around even though we had more potential then we let ourselves hold onto. There are many examples that we all can find ourselves fitting into. What are some of you regrets from your school life? I know while playing LIS a lot of repressed regrets came back to annoy me.
/////////////////////
So I'm curious... Who here has played Gone Home? I just played and finished it today and *loved* it. So many things are so similar to LiS and I knew that a lot of LiS fans loved it prior to playing it. Sam and Lonnie's relationship reminded me of Chloe and Max's in so many ways. 

For those of you who haven't played it or don't know anything about it, basically it's an exploration game. It's quite short, somewhere between 2 or 3 hours if you look at everything, and follows the story of 17 year old Samantha and her friend Lonnie who eventually end up becoming 'romantically involved'. You play as Katie, the older sister of Samantha, and basically you're trying to figure out where she is. In the process, you learn more about her and Lonnie and their relationship... It's just so cute. What I loved about the story is that it isn't the "typical teen love story", there's so much more than that. It's a first-person game which originally turned me off at first, but the story is just so intriguing and I wanted to find out more. I highly recommend you play it if you haven't already. Definitely worth it. 
/////////////////////
I just finished the game and I need more. What other video games do you suggest I check out now? PC platform please.

Edit: to clarify, not games that necessarily have the same time altering mechanics but one with a compelling story.
/////////////////////
So I finished the game for the first time about a week ago and was instantly broken and depressed and probably the same story that's been posted a million times on here before. After doing nothing but reading stuff on this subreddit and anything I could find LiS related (and generally just obsessing over it) I played through the game again, not knowing what to do with myself.


Now I finished it a second time and I want to keep playing it over and over and live in LiS forever. The game struck quite a few chords with me and made me realize and (forced me to) confront a lot of issues in my life I have been avoiding like my desperate longing for a love/soul mate just like max and chloe, the fact that I have no idea what I want to do with my life major/career wise, and the list goes on. Even though that second one isn't directly relevant to the game it just sparked a chain reaction of things I started freaking out about, but aside from making me realize all of this LiS also lets me live out that love fantasy (as well as many other things) but I don't want to just keep escaping into the game again. Every post I read on here about "post LiS depression" and everything just has people encouraging others to consume for LiS stuff whether its the game itself, fan fiction, art, music, etc. I don't want to just drown this out I want to fix this stuff but I don't know how and again everyone in similar situations that I've read just gets pointed at more LiS stuff to consume. Maybe I'm expecting too much to get answers from a post on reddit but I don't know what else to do or who else would understand the game and what it can do. 








EDIT: Thank you all so much for your kind words and advice! I feel a lot better after reading what you posted and knowing that there is this entire community here to talk to. This is a wonderful little pocket of the internet that I'm glad I found. 
/////////////////////
Hey, remember like a year ago when Episode 4 came out, and a bunch of people were having problems launching the game? I never got to ever play Episode 4 or 5, so I tried launching the game today just to see it it would work, and it still didn't work a year later. 

Has there ever been an actual fix to this, besides reinstalling the things in the "_CommonRedist" folder? Because that didn't work for me. I've tried almost every other "fix" I can remember, like unplugging my headset, and all that stuff, still doesn't work.
/////////////////////
Well, how do I describe it? 

I completed LiS ~6 months ago. Ever since I've felt a thirst, something missing from me. 

Just finished "To The Moon", now I feel like that thirst is quenched. 

It was just as powerful. It was exactly like LiS and nothing like it at the same time. Just what I needed.

Idk why, I just immediately though of coming to this sub. Sadly /r/tothemoongame is a ghost town.

Anyways, you guys should check it out :)
/////////////////////
I do deal with my problems, it's just problem after problem. Just want to fuckin get rid of this.
/////////////////////
I watched Dodger's playthrough of Ep1 at release and loved how it captured the feeling of a 'coming of age' movie, and Dodger's playthrough left enough missing/intrigue for me to want to play it myself instead of just watching. (and I'm not one to watch/sub to any LetsPlay type content)

I bought EP1, loved it, bought the rest and told myself I wouldn't succumb to the cliffhangers per episode and would wait until all were released before touching it again.

But after not thinking about it for a while, I lost motivation to make time to play through it. Thankfully I got bored enough 3 days ago to do just that and the ending still has me thinking about it.

---
spoilers below obviously


---

What surprised me the most were how people were reacting to the writing of the ending - particularly, how people think there was a "proper" ending (saving bay).

I'm baffled, I didn't see it that way at all. 

To me, the ending was a test of how you (as Max) grew as a character by the end of the story. It was the ultimate personality question: **Has Max grown strong enough to make a decision for herself and her best friend? Or has she grown to care even more for others? To always think and choose the best for those around her?**

Max is established as a quiet, shy, and non-aggressive person when the game starts. **That (has the potential to) stops the minute the game hands over control to you.** You do not HAVE to play Max as the character that is established. 

You can play as someone who confidently embraces/utilizes her new power, or someone who tries to fit the pre-established role of Max and using her new power just to fix bad mistakes. This choice is really apparent as early as how you handle the paint on Victoria - do you embrace the fact that you did it and make fun of her? or do you remain your quiet and comforting self and comfort her?

Then you're reconnected with Chloe, who is the opposite of you. She makes you do things you never would. She puts you in situations you never would get into. The whole game is littered with choice of how you mesh with her personality. Do you embrace her crazy ideas? Do you just play damage control as her "angel's advocate" to her spontaneous nature? 

**What makes Chloe and Max such a great pair? Why is Chloe your ultimate +1? Is it because being with Chloe help Max come out of her shell? Chloe makes Max a better person? Or are you Chloe's great equalizer? Do you bring the wild, trouble-maker Chloe down? There is no wrong answer - it is the interpretation of EVERY choice you made throughout the game.**

All the choices in the game DID matter. Just because it didn't give you more than two endings is missing the point. EVERY choice up to the final question was a personality choice. They were tests. They were shaping how you shape Max's character. The final question was the ultimate question on what kind of person your Max has become by the end of the journey.
/////////////////////
Ok, so this isn't a "just finished the game" post but more my take on the overall story and ending.  
I'll try to stop crying and listening to the soundtrack for a minute to give an opinion some might find redundant, but just my 2 cents.  
  
I've seen a few posts here asking why saving Chloe prevents a storm, or expressing distaste with the Bae ending as it won't "solve" whatever caused the tornado.  
  
I like to think The Butterfly Effect is in full and literal effect here.  
Now I understand that The Butterfly Effect doesn't literally mean a butterfly flapping it's wings could cause a tornado, but that's how you grasp the concept. That's how it's represented.  
  
When Max is in the bathroom, and prevents the gunshot, the same Chloe-Blue Butterfly we see might fly away from the gunshot and cause the tornado in the end.
  
I guess my overall point is that it's not some magic, or something unexplainable.  
  
It's The Butterfly Effect. Small changes now can result in huge changes later. There are a few "mystical" or unexplainable things in LiS but to me, the ending isn't one of them.  

/////////////////////
As we all know that right from the very beginning of Life Is Strange. Max was dealt with something that no one her age(or anyone for that matter) should have to experience. From there she discovers she has this ability and overtakes a responsibility that she may or may not have wanted.

Looking back on the "simple" life that we mostly live. How would you handle the stress that life gives you? Would you work to try and improve despite what fate may bring? Or would you accept the consequences and consider it your destiny?
/////////////////////
Hi all. I know you must have read a million of these "reactions" to EP 5 but I just thought I'd like to share mine since time has passed and maybe some of you have been able to find a way to cope. I beat the game "Life is Strange"  probably about..6 months ago, but I still can't get over it. 

This is definitely the most painful game I have ever played and one of the most emotionally stressing things of my life. I've been through so much turmoil over my decisions and I'd just like to discuss why on here.

I was already aware of the barebones of the game and how the game ended because my girlfriend had asked me to help her make the final choice, but she's a clever girl and didn't really specify who I was affecting or anything about the characters - only to sacrifice this or that. A and B. As it turns out, I chose to save Chloe (for her) and she ultimately chose to sacrifice her. 

When I played myself, I had a little bit of that in mind when I played, but I figured that if I distanced myself enough, then I wouldn't feel so bad. Oh man was I **wrong**. I immediately got attached to the game. First of all, me and Max share a lot of qualities, I'd like to think. Though we've grown up in entirely different worlds. She likes photography, and so do I. I'm not good at it or anything, and I'm actually kind of photosensitive, but I've always had a fascination with time and that's because..

My life has been very difficult. In the past, I've had to go through a lot of family and friend death, some of which I feel has been caused by me. Right now I'm not even sure of one of my ex's is alive, after he said he was going to kill himself and I haven't really seen or heard his presence anywhere. I always have been asking myself what I could do over, what I could do differently to get a different fate. I feel like what I did (separating us) was the right choice, because our lives were rapidly heading in different directions and I couldn't bear to draw him further into the hell I was about to go into. But what if I did? What would have happened? No, what would have happened if I never fixed my Xbox? Without that, we would have never met, I wouldn't have had the best years of my life, nor my current girlfriend, and I may not even be alive. All these questions in my head and I always just wish I could do things differently.

Starting off this game, I saw that I had the power in my hands to do something I'd always dreamed of. This was my chance to play around with the thing that I'd desired. 

After meeting Chloe and finding out her backstory and interacting with her and Victoria and Nick and other characters, I began to have a true appreciation for them. The graphics aren't the best but it felt like how any sort of life could go. I felt like I could see myself in that situation, having distanced myself from a friend for a long time and finally getting to reunite, and having to find a way to make it up to them when they've changed so much in my absence, and learning of another friend who has gone missing. 

I honestly wanted to help Chloe find her friend and even though she clearly changed from the past, I still loved the girl. I could say I even say I fell in love with her, though I'd never be able to tell her, especially after she pulled away from the kiss. Sexual preference of either Max or Chloe wasn't something I thought about in the game, but it still had me going to sleep that night sort of bothered as if she maybe did want it but pulled away because of something she was keeping secret. But that's enough of that, I'm sure there are enough fics of the two already (although I will be bringing this back up later).

The first time I really cried nonstop was when I failed to save Kate. Out of my happy-go-lucky and newby nature when I started the game, I hadn't paid attention to her requests and only helped her when the video of her went viral by erasing the site links. Though to be honest I was curious what she did. It's never explicitly stated in the game I think but as an adult now I think it's pretty clear what went on - kissing alone would not humiliate you like that - not enough to kill yourself. I struggled very hard with the options I had to save her, but I ultimately chose her mom, and that's when she jumped. I kept spamming rewind, trying to undo it, but I couldn't. It was a point locked in time beyond my control, and that's when I first doubted that I was the "god" that I previously felt I had become. I don't know why that had to happen right then, I don't know why it had to fail right then, because if I could have I would have done it all over again. I realised how much of a failure I am at saving people. Games have a very unique way of displaying tendencies in our nature, sometimes even subconscious ones. I don't know if anyone here watches Game Theory, but I think the Mario as an evil character video(s) were actually interesting. We take what we're presented as as the truth. We don't question that we're the bad guy, crushing innocents and abusing our allies. We just do as we assume are our instructions. It's cold. Just like that, I feel that this game revealed or rather reminded me of my inability to save anyone. In this game I was given a power I wanted so badly, and at that moment as the very last bit of life left her, I was powerless. 

And then the father business. I was ecstatic at the idea of helping Chloe get back something she'd lost - what ultimately changed her the most. I felt bad about separating mum and step-dad, but I forged an ultimatum in my head - that it was better to let Chloe  be a normal, happy girl than what I could only assume was a bit of an emotional wreck inside. But despite this, there was a part of my mind, a part that was very much screaming at me that this would **not** end up the way I thought it would.

When I knocked on the door, my heart sank. Time slowed down. I didn't even need to see her in the wheelchair. The angle of the shot alone told me everything before she even came on screen. I died a little. I felt I $@%!ed up big time. My mind was racing, my heart was beating so incredibly fast. I felt like I was Max there, and I couldn't even muster a smile upon seeing her. The next bit of time after that, I was hoping Max would just quickly undo what we just did, but instead I saw her with Chloe as the dead whale carcasses built up. I just wanted to scream at myself and at her. I was so angry, I was pissed on such a high level. It was a trap, and I fell for it. Why did I do it? Was I even doing it for Chloe? Or just to change her for my own (and everyone around her's) benefit? Then she asked me, no, begged me to die. 

I couldn't feel a single tear on my face because my body ran cold. I debated the pros and cons for half an hour or more. I was so indecisive, but I ultimately decided to kill her. I tried to calm down and listen to her, and when I did, I could see she was already dead. She was costing her parents more than she ever could feel her life is worth, if you could even call that a "life", and on top of that, she was going to die at some point anyway. Knowing how expensive medical bills can be, I couldn't take it. I couldn't take letting her live with that on her hands. I felt that it was the right thing to do. Even so, it was hard, but I just really hoped I could go back. Thankfully, I could.

By this point, I had already been exposed to so many wears in the game that I didn't feel like I could handle much more heartbreak, but then we found the body and.. I actually felt sick. I didn't think that she was there. I didn't even believe it afterwards at first. The thought twisted my head and ripped my brain apart. I thought that one of the primary objectives of the game was to find her, as if she had moved away or if she was still alive and captive. But no, she was dead. **Long** dead. I didn't have any hatred for Nathan at that time, only an intense fear. I was scared for Choe's sake and wanted to just grab her and run out of there. I actually had a panic attack. I went paranoid and my thoughts started racing again. I couldn't process what happened and I just kept continuing on on muscle memory alone. 

This post is getting a bit long so maybe I can cut to the end - the big decision. When I got to this part, it was the hardest part for me. When confronted initially, I chose to sacrifice the Bay. Why? Because I loved Chloe, and I needed her, and I felt like the situation of Chloe and Max was a mirror of me and my girlfriend, but that is a story for another time. I felt like this was my chance to say to her how I felt about us, and to say to Chloe how Max (me) felt about her. I saved her. But as time went on a nagging feeling grew. It felt selfish. It felt wrong. We could be happy together, though, I thought. But then, who is to say that Chloe would not meet some unfortunate fate at some later point in the future? Who is to guarantee that Chloe wouldn't eventually become discontent with my choice and ultimately leave? Were we still just friends or did Chloe love Max in _that_ way to start a relationship and try to forget the past?

So after some weeks, I went back. I chose the choice that I stand by to this day. *I killed my best friend*. And this is what sent me into a long and deeper depression than almost any one I've been in before. I felt utterly useless, powerless, a manipulator, a thief, and a selfish idiot all at once. I had played with the lives of so many people, I had probably created and destroyed so many timelines, I had probably killed many on a third-party just like when I accidentally let Frank be shot. I hated myself even more then than I had ever hated myself before. But no matter what I did, I ultimately %!@$ed up **massively**. I failed on every level to protect anything I cared about. What made this worse for me is that I made Chloe's mom kick out step-dad, and they never got to "make up" because I didn't tell her what happened in the alt world on the sacrifice the bay choice. She and he (likely) died not knowing, not being able to make amends. Because of **me**. 

And even if I do sacrifice Chloe, I've lost someone that cannot be replaced. I've heard so many times that there are many fish in the sea. **Bull$@%#**. To me, she was everything. And yet this was the right thing to do, wasn't it? I'll never forget a comment on a YouTube video saying that the choice was merely a red herring, and that players are naturally supposed to choose to sacrifice Chloe, because all the symbolism points to it. The way she has died so many times, the bullet chain, her dying on the grave, you getting the ability to warp time coincidentally after you see her die the first time, the butterfly (perceived to be her spirit).

At the present, I feel more calmed down about this but I can't let it go. My girlfriend got me to at least feel hope that Chloe is happy, as a butterfly, still watching over the Bay and Max and will love her forever. When I went back to sacrifice her, I didn't get the kiss, because I couldn't bare to redo the entire episode to undo Warren's kiss, but I saved it off of Google. Despite all the horrendous stuff that happens in the game, that is the most heart-shattering. It made me feel so empty, and even now I can't be happy with it. Sure, I can just go back and do another choice or think of some incredible way to weasel my way out of the pain by explaining it all away, but I can't do that to myself. I don't want to live a lie. I feel like it would be so to imagine my own ending. Like other things in life, you can't choose what happens to you or where you come from or how you look, and I was placed into this world and meant to experience these things. If there is one thing I feel I've learned, it's to not play god any longer in others' lives. I can't make my own ending anymore for what I want to be, I can only accept what I've been given. And that terrifies me. 

Life is rough and life is strange, I look forward to season 2, but I don't know if I can ever get over this. Despite that I can't undo anything, it doesn't make it any easier, it doesn't make me feel less guilty, and I don't feel like I've been a good friend to Chloe, a good resident of Arcadia Bay, a good student of the high school, or even a good adversary to Jefferson.

I never thought that a game could destroy me like this. Never. I've been able to push things out before by simply not going to funerals or filling my mind with happy thoughts, but not this time. Not now. 

Just an anecdote, Chloe dies after hearing Nate say that no one cares about her, and she never does know (as a human) that you're there, and that you came back. She dies without feeling the love of anyone.

I just miss her. I will never forget her, and I can never forget the others I've lost. 

I have to say, this game has influenced a lot on me. I've been writing (my brain is rolling its eyes right now as I'm technically on hiatus) a story and I wanted the ending to ultimately be a choice to the reader, just like LiS. I wanted everything in the story to depend on that final moment, but still leave it up to the reader to think that maybe even if they did choose a sacrifice that they did, things would end up the same.
/////////////////////
There's a bunch of Max ones included in the LIS media kit, but does anyone have any chloe ones that they use?
/////////////////////
Why did saving Chloe literally start the apocalypse? I mean all the other choices you make in the game have a clear cause and effect, but there is seemingly no reason for Chloe being alive starting a tornado, two moons, an eclipse, etc. 

And if I had kept her alive (yes I sacrificed her) wouldn't that mean there's no reason for the apocalypse to stop? So as long as she was alive, theoretically, shouldn't the ~~world~~ universe just keep being ravaged until it was completely destroyed all because I didn't stop myself from saving Chloe?

As we all know that in episode 4 you are finally able to do some investigating. During your investigation you find a list of names. Among them you find Stella and if I remember correctly someone named Kate. What do you think of them buying drugs and do you believe that Kate was a buyer?
/////////////////////
as some of you may know, i've been trying to do a straight play-through of LiS on youtube.  i've been using plays.tv (recorder software that is included with the AMD Drivers i have) it works alright. however for the last 2 episodes (4 and 5) it has been fucking up on me. I had you play through the second half of 4 like 3 or 4 times. for those of you who have played it, you know how rough that can be.  
now i am working on ep5, and i played through and recorded the first...47 minutes or so. you may have seen the wallpaper i posted. i didnt take that shot in game. i had opened up the video after the fact, and took a screenshot from that. now i've played through the next 50 minutes or so, go to check that the session recorded, and what's this? only one file, well shit, i guess i could do that.....wait what? this is the most recent one...where is the one from a few days ago.....that i used to get that wallpaper....  
anyway, just a little rant about software fuckin up on me. feel free to share your stories or w/e.  
also the game it self had some issues, one scene where max is talking to joyce, max's mouth wouldnt move but her dialogue continued...it was fucked up
/////////////////////
I remember some months ago I read that they're working on a new LiS game/season. Anyone know some details about it? 
/////////////////////
it felt like the story went down the hill after episode 2 or 3


/////////////////////
So, this may be a weird or extremely hypothetical question, but I'm currently working on a continuation of the story in Twine (which is very cathartic, by the way) and since I don't live in the US and am at best only vaguely familiar with your legal system, I was hoping maybe someone could shed a bit of light onto these questions:

Let's assume Max went back in time and managed to warn people about both Jefferson and the Tornado and he and Nathan would be arrested.

-Roughly how long would it realistically take for the case to go to trial and how long could such a trial last?

-Would there be 2 entirely seperate trials for them or just one? And if 2, could they be significantly seperated in time and/or space or would they be more likely to take place in a similar timeframe and place?

-What crimes would they be specifically charged with and what would be a realistic sentence for the two of them respectively? I'm not asking for an exact verdict, just a rough estimate of what could be a believable outcome.

I very much appreciate any and all insight :)

Personally, I'm torn between having Chloe and Max be in the game. One half of me says that it's a fantastic idea because you would have Max be dragged back into using her powers, but it would force the devs to choose a timeline that they are calling "canon" unless they want to make 2 games. At the same time, I almost feel like giving the power to some new, faceless dude/dudette would almost be an insult to the original game. I REALLY hope they don't do something like make some sort of alien mutation that gives people the ability to rewind time. I don't know what I want, but I know that I want more Life Is Strange. Honestly, I wouldn't mind paying 30 instead of 20 for a more branching storyline. I know that the danger in that is creating content that not every player will see, and fuck I'd be glad to pay 40 up front for a 5 part episodic where there's more than 2 endings and shit like that. All I know is that I want more choice and I want a good story. Sorry Square Enix, I'm not really a whole lot of help.

I think that a game in another small town that faces some sort of other awful and scary teen drama is the right place to go, maybe have some sort of alternate universe thing where you just create another town and so there wouldn't be news of a freak tornado, but then if they just rehash the whole "spooky tornado" thing it feels like a cop out, GOD I just want more Life is Strange.
/////////////////////
Maybe someone her can help, I got LiS from steam cause it's good enough to have on multiple platforms :) Anyway I'm getting a strange graphical issue with shadow rendering when in view of a light source. It's like a thatched grid pattern over the character until I move from the light then everything is fine: I have all the settings maxxed and have tried adjusting them to no effect. I'm using a AMD R9 with 8Gb and drivers are up to date. Has anyone here experienced this on PC?

so i look up the VA, and suddenly I realize why I don't trust him much. Derek Phillips is the voice of both Maxson and Jefferson.

One thing I've noticed since I've started following this subreddit is that it seems like a lot of people really want, or even expect, a sequel to LiS 2. Incidentally, the thought hadn't even crossed my mind after finishing the game, so what I'm wondering is, is this really necessary (let alone viable)?

I'd like to get something out of the way before the discussion begins:

I'm not really concerned with what the devs are saying on the subject at the moment. This is a hypothetical conversation. If the devs say they want to / are planning on making a sequel, either direct or spiritual, so be it, but that's not what I'd like this discussion to be about. If that's all we were going to talk about, the discussion would end pretty quickly.

So with that out of the way, as I said, the thought hadn't even crossed my mind after finishing the game, and I still don't think I want one, or at least not a direct one. I'd be fine with a LiS 2 with a new premise, but I think Max and Chloe's story has been told and I just don't see what a sequel could do that would have the same impact on me. If the devs have some brilliant idea, so be it, but I can't even imagine what they could do.

Furthermore, given the ending, they would either have to make essentially two different games, or through some means invalidate the ending of the original. The former seems unlikely, and the latter seems undesirable.

To reiterate, a good idea is a good idea and if it happens, and it's done well, I would be thrilled, but in this hypothetical sense I personally don't see the appeal.

But what do you all think?

Hey everyone, 

a friend of mine would love to do a collage of all the Life is Strange tattoos the community got. I've seen many good ones here already, so in this post I ask anyone of you with a cool tattoo if you would like to contribute to her collage. Be it Chloe's complete sleeve or just a little blue butterfly on your wrist, anything is really appreciated. If we get enough submissions for the collage, I will post the result when it's finished. And if you just want to show off your tattoo without being part of the collage, that's totally fine too, just say so :)

So anyone interested, just post a link with your tattoo here :)

HELLO AGAIN! And thanks for reading this! :)

So, I am a guy from Europe, specifically from the UK. And as the title says, I've decided to travel to the beautiful Pacific Northwest region this summer. One of the reasons I finally went through with this decision is my love for LIS, the game. It was not the primary reason, but upon playing through the game, seeing all the beautiful sceneries, I've made my decision final and started saving up for the trip. I will be travelling alone, renting a car, driving down from Seattle to Portland, OR and then down the Oregon Coast to Northern Cali and then back up to Portland and Seattle. The whole trip will last around two weeks, and I am excited about it beyond measure. :) So currently, I've booked the tickets from London to Seattle, where I will be landing on Wednesday the 17th of August, in the evening.

What I was hoping for was to find someone who would like to spend some time with me in Seattle during my 2day stay. Someone who would like to make a new friend, show me around, spend some time with me and perhaps, if not a bother, would not mind me spending two nights on their couch. This would not be without a compensation and I am more than happy to do something for you in return, e.g. clean your house, cook something for/with you, or even simply pay for your hospitality.

Now, you might be asking, why, out of all the possible places, would you go to LIS forum on reddit and ask for something like this?!

My answer to this is: I am asking for some new friends in the first place. :) This community has been one of the nicest and most supportive one out of all the reddit communities I've visited in the past. Plus, we share love for some amazing piece of art, a game about nostalgia, beautiful sunset, love for our friends and people close to our heart, stunning natural beauty and friendship and love in general. This must mean something, and must somehow be telling of the people liking this game and visiting this community. That is, why I turned to this community first. Because I believe that someone from here, if willing, would have something in common with me, and that we could enjoy doing the same or at least very similar things together, even if it's just watching the sunset. :)

I will be of course inquiring about this in /r/seattle and /r/portland too, but I wanted this community be the first one where I ask. Hope it's not too much of a bother. :P

A bit of info about me: I am a 26 years old male from a smaller town in the UK. I was not born in the UK, but came living here from other EU country some years ago. Loved the lovely Britain and stayed. I am friendly, a bit introverted, but this is going to be my trip of a lifetime, so I wanted to spice it up by getting to know some amazing people. :) I am happy to chat through other channels if anyone would take me on my offer and would want to know me better before arriving. Not a problem there! :)

BTW people, all of this is valid for Portland and Oregonian coastal towns too! If you are from any of these places, please, let me know if you are willing to meet and we can! You can show me around, we can hang out for a day and have a great time! It would be awesome! [I've enclosed a map](http://imgur.com/EWd6CfC) of my presumptive route I will be taking, so you can see if your place is anywhere nearby. Let me know! :)

So... I guess, thanks for reading this, sorry for a wall of text, I will be more than happy to get in touch with anyone willing to take me on this and I sincerely hope I can meet at least some of you guys and have a great time with you! 

Thanks! :)

This is a lightly edited brain dump

I couldn't bear playing episode 5 for 7 months. I didn't want to go toward that dark place... The story is fiction, but it's so well crafted... It's like it's what I fear the world could be like.

They say the mind can't tell truth from fiction, that something imagined is as real as an actual experience. I'm not scared it could happen to me, I'm just glad we live in a better world. Or worse yet, I know those types of events really do happen, and that the only thing separating me from being part of them is just luck and chance. My good fortune not to attract death and destruction. My view of the world has always been that small problems are the only problems. It's all I've experienced. I'm filled with sadness to see what others go through. To experience it for myself.

And I'm angry. Angry that I couldn't save everyone, angry that the game didn't end with the art gallery... I'm mad the writers didn't tell the story from my world view. Where the hero wins, no one dies, and the villains see the evil of their ways. Angry that their view of science and the butterfly effect was so flexible yet so arbitrarily ridged and bullshit. TIME IS A RIVER NOT A FUCKING GLASS FRACTAL. Drop a rock in a river and it flows around to join back up. And we didn't need the storm to be a major theme in the story. Yeah maybe that could have happened, but if Max's changes were having that kind of effect why wouldn't it have been changing every time? or more widespread? 

Really though, when it comes down to it, the end was still light years better than Mass Effect 3. That was just horse shit. I don't care how much alien techno babble you patch in later, that doesn't make up for it. 


**I read fiction to play in fantastical created worlds, not be tortured in them.**

As we all know we have several instances in the game where Max can and does do some questionable things. Have you been in a situation like that where you know you could do something without getting in trouble? Would you be mean to someone if you never would know it was you?

does anyone think that square enix might reveal a season 2 trailer? i want hope. i want to believe

I was curious if you're a fan of any of the numerous film and television shows that are referenced by or inspired the game?  Here's my list.

Blade Runner: Maybe my favorite sci-fi film.  Great atmosphere and soundtrack.

Back to the Future: Near the top of my most rewatchable movies list.  Love the trilogy.

The Shining: I know Stephen King hates the movie but it's my favorite horror film.  Honorable mention to the IT reference during the nightmare sequence (Tim Curry's clown scared the crap out of me as a kid).

Twin Peaks: One of the first shows that caused me to obssess over all the subtle details and mythology.  I enjoy most of David Lynch's work (Mulholland Dr and Lost Highway in particular).

Breakfast Club: Not really related but one of my faves.  Gives me a lot of the same vibes and feelings as LIS, and how appropriate is the ending song?

/////////////////////
I've seen a lot of people having trouble coping with life after LiS. A lot of us want something similar, so I will suggest the game that actually got me into games like LiS.

I played SH2 many years ago, while suffering from severe depression, and it was a major gut punch. A lot of people think that Silent Hill is about spooky monsters and scary noises, but SH2 is actually about a man dealing with the death of his wife, and each monster represents an emotion associated with it.

In the story, you meet several people who have some sort of issue that society likes to consider "taboo" or that people are generally uncomfortable talking about. Some of these uncomfortable issues are things like molestation, rape, abuse, mental illness, suicide and the death of a young child.

I had been looking for several years for another game that had a similar story line to SH2, something taboo, dark, depressing and sad and LiS was that game.

The problem is, a lot of people go into SH2 thinking it's similar to Resident Evil and fail to digest the story behind it. So, if you do play SH2, pay attention to the story more than you pay attention to the gameplay.

Was told I should post this here by a few people.
It's been a bit of an uphill climb but I'm finally back to work on 'All Wounds,' so I hope you enjoy what I've been able to put together for Chapter 2, which takes place from Chloe's perspective, so you'll get an idea of how her decision-making will work a little differently than Max's, as well as the narrative tone of her chapters. By now, the project has about 2 hours of content to soak up. Would love some feedback, though if it's about the artwork, just know I can't really do anything about that -- this is a passion project I'm doing mostly solo, so I have to work with what I can! And Shannon, who does the sprites, is an artist I have a good rapport with and trust.

Anyway, I'm hoping the gap between chapters won't be nearly as long next time!
/////////////////////
Fuck me. As soon as I finished the game, i felt destroyed. I did save Chloe however, driving through the town and seeing absolutely no one walking around was crushing.

The alternate realities also killed me. Seeing all of the trade offs between Chloe and her family buried by hospital bills, Max getting the award and having Jefferson arrested, etcetera. Seeing how there was just no perfect result...

And the dialogue and writing good god. I felt like it was so real at times. I didn't save Kate and the comments that you get for not saving her. Im not usually affected by stuff like that, but god damn getting hounded like that after someone you tried to save committed suicide is so brutal.

The fact that it did just come down to two decisions and nothing else ended up mattering was disappointing, but the decision was so hard hitting that i didn't really care.

I never had the feeling to talk about a game's story like this before but god damn I felt like I just needed to get it off my chest.
/////////////////////
Whenever I come to this reddit or whenever I see people talking about this game on other sites, I never see the kind of hate comments you usually see when people talk about games. Everyone is so awesome and friendly and I've honestly never seen anything like it.

It's just so awesome to see people talk about their own journeys. Life is Strange takes you on a journey so emotional and carries with it such a powerful message about so many different things that go on in our lives (love, sadness, hope, heartbreak, suicide, drugs, death of a loved one, etc.) that it affects us all in a way that most games, movies or books can't. We can all relate to some aspect of this game on a deep level. 

I think at this point I'm beginning to ramble and lose track of my original point but I'm sure a lot of you can agree with me when I say that Life is Strange evokes so many emotions over the course of it's 5 episodes. When I think of LiS, I have a strange mixture of comforting nostalgia, warm joy, cold anxiety and tinge of sadness. I've never had a game affect me so, and it's amazing to see that it's affected so many people in the same way it's affected me. And it's amazing to see that people don't hatefully argue about stupid things and instead relay their own experiences with the game and why it makes them feel the way they do.

LiS is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I will keep coming back to this game for years.
/////////////////////
So I'm aware of the fact that the soundtrack is available on spotify as a playlist, and have been listening to it quite exhaustively. I also was familiar with Syd Matters, and I've heard other bands that I think have a similar kind of sound, such as Kings of Convenience. I know also that movies such as Juno have a similar soundtrack.

However, what I don't quite know is what to call this genre of music. I've generally called it folk or indie, but I imagine there is some more specific name (although maybe not). I'd like to explore this genre more, so any help, in terms of specific songs or bands, or help in identifying the genre, would be appreciated.
/////////////////////
I noticed recently, that upon returning to the original timeline, the condoms are gone from chloe's wallet I find this very interesting, but i wonder if this always occurs, or if particular decisions must be taken for this to occur.
/////////////////////
As the title says, I've found myself every night for an hour or so picking through the chapters and repaying certain parts of the game, more of the lighter happier moments. It's good therapy. I actually enjoy this more than I would a full play through, it will take a very special mood or day before I can face Ep5 again. Anyone else?
/////////////////////
I had never heard of this game until right before it came out. I heard Yogscast Hannah and Kim talking about it right before it came out and I was uninterested - I overlooked everything they said. But when it came out I made a great choice - I decided to see their first episodes of it. After just one episode I realised I needed this game. I bought it as soon as I could - I treasured it. I waited day in day out for the announcements of each episode - I played them the days they came out. The release dates are still drilled into my mind. I fell in love with it - and my love for it just got stronger as the game went on. It made me a better person - strange to think I never realised how important this game would be to me. It influenced me so much and now all I want is a Season Two. It's extremely rare that something has this influence on me. 

So thank you DONTNOD. Thank you Life is Strange.
And thank you all you amazing Strangers (get it - you know, double meaning. Just me, no?) 

Here's to hope of a Season Two and a love like this coming back. I'd go as far as to say this game helped me see brightness and positivity in life. It gave me a reason to live. So DONTNOD you better announce Season Two at Gamescom or E3 because I know there are others like me would love that as an announcement at E3 more than anything else. Thanks again! 

:)
/////////////////////
Honestly, I really like doing these daily topics everyday. Whether there are 5 comments or 100 comments. Getting various viewpoints on this game and the issues addressed is kinda refreshing. Hell, I had a pretty good topic for today but I just so happened to check my twitter and saw a particular hashtag trending. I won't go into details but you can [click here](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/06/10/orlando-concert-shooting/85733840/) or check twitter right now as it is the number one trend to know more. 

Now, I didn't know who this person was at all. Though, following it and seeing the events unfold hit to close too home for me. Right now its 3:49AM and I'm thinking about many things that I've blocked from my mind. Taking me back to tragedies that my family has faced and wondering how we got through it. 

This daily topic doesn't have a set discussion and is open for anything. It can be LIS related or not related to the game at all. This topic is purely on what's weighing on your mind today. So, from here on out the weekend daily topics will open for anything. 
/////////////////////
Okay, so while I was still processing the whole Chaos Theory stuff I came up with this question.  
  
If all these weather effects occur because Chloe survived then how come going back in time to prevent it helps it? I mean Max is definitely gonna reveal Jefferson to police which was not supposed to happen too...or she would definitely comfort Kate more whereas she wouldn't have done that without the knowledge of future and so on.  
  
I understand that specifically Chloe's survival has led to Tornado but aren't there supposed to be even more critical changes because Max knowledge and experience will eventually change original timeline anyway? I guess this could only work if she wouldn't have remembered anything from her experience thus not having information to alter the reality.  
   
After this conclusion I cannot seriously accept Chloe's destiny. How is her destiny more important than Jefferson's crimes and Kate being upset?
/////////////////////
I told a friend about how much I love LIS, he decided to try it, I'm watching him broadcast now and it almost feels like the first time I played it! 

For anyone that misses Arcadia Bay, this is pretty awesome.
/////////////////////
Hi everyone. Signed up to Reddit just so I could post here and talk about this.

I finished the game on Tuesday. Despite what quite a lot of people think, I loved the last episode. It drew (nearly) everything together, and the dream sequence was amazing. The moment when you're back in the classroom, and blood starts splattering against the window and then disappears, is one of my favourite images in the game.

I chose the Bay ending, it was tough to watch, but I'm glad I did. Trying again to save Chloe just seemed like putting off the inevitable, at the expense of hurting even more people. To me, both Max and Chloe seemed to know what they had to do.

But my problem is, I don't just feel sad at Life Is Strange being over. I feel empty and helpless at losing Max. Because of the way the game ended, even if there's a Season 2, it would be impossible for Max to be the protagonist. And I just can't deal with that. I've never played a game with a protagonist like Max, someone so human and earnest and positive and cynical and conflicted and loving and kind, and also occasionally kinda lame and embarrassing and real. Max is strong and determined, but in such a quiet way. She's not super confident, she's not outwardly sassy and witty (even though inside, she's both those things), she's not aggressive, and she has a subtle but very present sense of her own identity.

There was so much more to explore in her character, and it'll never happen now. I know there is fanfic etc, which is really great, but it's not the same. I want to play as her, explore as her, hear her internal monologue. 

I've never identified with a character as much as I identified with Max. She's everything I both am, and wish I was. I'm a 26 year old male, by the way.

Hello,
I found this old video (Feburary 2015) from [GeekRemix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsfrTcCumw8) about playing the rewind sound effects backwards and hearing actual words. User /u/RenegadeWade posted all [sound files](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrangeleaks/comments/3qni1e/ep5_spoilers_release_life_is_strange_complete/) from LiS and made it easy to reverse the "voice" files. The files related to rewinding I found were GEN_Rewind.033 to GEN_Rewind.042. These are all in the Episode 1 files and unfortunately couldn't find any in the other Episodes files. I stitched them reversed together as a wav: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3zcA8o1H3C0S01ObFFsOWxGeU0/view?usp=sharing

Sorry, nothing really new there. I really hoped that they changed the sound effect per Episode. Would have been amazing if you could hear events/words from the future after the final choice while rewinding in Episode 5. I hope this was somewhat interesting, though not original.

PS: I love reading this subreddit, thanks guys and girls and sorry any newbie mistakes :)
/////////////////////
I just got Season 1 of Life Is Strange and I really need to know if there will be a season 2.
/////////////////////
Hey guys, I've just finished this awesome experience (I refuse to describe it as just a "game").

I loved it. I lost myself completely in Max's mind and her internal struggle.
I said goodbye to Chloe and prepared myself for a life of shuddering everytime I see a blue butterfly.

So... I'm a playwright and director, and the main reason I decided to try LiS is that recently I've been fascinated by the idea of writing a play about time travel, and the possibility of altering your past, and the inevitable consequences.
So, I've been thinking about writing a show based on the story of LiS.

Do you think a theatre play could somehow convey the spirit of LiS?
Which elements would you absolutely include, and which ones, due to technical impossibility, would you -sadly- gloss over?

I'm super curious to hear your thoughts!
And of course, I'd be glad to elaborate on my idea if you're interested :)


/////////////////////
I've seen a lot of movies and have played a lot of video games. I've seen people cry during movies and I've never understood it. Today I had to make the "big choice" at the end of Life is Strange. Some dialogue and events unfold and I found my eyes getting watery. Congrats Dontnod, after all these years I have finally shed a tear over a story.
/////////////////////
Much like the rest of you I came here looking for support or encouragement after my whirlwind emotional ride through the game. I have felt all the telltale signs of that vast emptiness and self reflection, I had no idea it would affect me on this level. I finished it Tuesday and im still thinking about it, however I wanted to thank the community here all of you, after reading a bit through here last night I felt that hole begin to fill up a bit and generally felt better. This morning I'm in that middle ground again but knowing everyone is here too with me is a big relief. I will share one amazing thing, one my way Into work this morning I decided to listen to a few tunes from the soundtrack and there before me was this huge rainbow that stayed within my view until I reached work. It has been sprinkling this morning so it was probably just enough to create one but I was like how poignant is that! Take care everyone there and thank you again!!

Give some scenarios where you could see QTE's be utilized in LIS.

I beat the game (or I should rather say the game beat me) 3 nights ago and I've since been thinking about it non-stop; my heart and mind still quite shaken....you know the feeling.     
Today I re-examined my reason to save Chloe and where I thought it was simply because I just couldn't bear to let her die on a dirty floor of a shitty bathroom, scared, lost and lonely (such a bad, miserable death!) on second thought that was only half the reason - maybe less than half. The other half was that I anyway didn't believe going back and changing 'again' things would have undone the storm at that point. Why? The answer to this question made me realize that there is actually another decision to be made (before the final one).   

Let me explain: in the last dialogue Max tells Chloe how she believes all the chaos is her fault, because of her using her rewind power to change things (a scene that for me was already heartbreaking since the poor girl wanted just to help and there she is, facing one of the outcomes - a huge angry storm about to eat up Arcadia). That's what I call "Max 's theory": the chaos was brought by her messing with time to change things, no matter what those things were. 

To that follows "Chloe's theory": she believes instead the reason still has to do with messing with time of course, but more specifically with the first instance of that, the one that started the series, which is preventing her to die. Here we the players are called to make a decision (the first one I'm talking about); it's a very subtle one as the game doesn't pause at that point nor there's any prompt to push this or that button but it's still there: do we believe things are more according to what Max assumes or Chloe?  It might seem not an important point but in fact will heavily affect the final decision. If we agree more with Max then we'll most likely choose to save Chloe, as going back in time 'again' would just add one more rewind/change to all those ones made already up to that moment, therefore most likely not undoing any storm and possibly making it even worse. With this viewpoint in mind we are spared the final dilemma because there's nothing really to choose, the only logical conclusion be stopping messing with time at once.    
If instead we agree more with Chloe then yes, we're faced with the ruthless necessity to choose who must die and that is.....hard, unfair and brutal.    
I think the devs were clever to have Chloe come up last with her argument. Had it been the other way around most players might have just sticked with "Max 's theory" and we'd have had possibly something like 90% save Chloe instead of slightly less that half. In other words they subtly lured us into the dilemma. Sneaky bastards.   

I've read quite some posts in several forums these last days and I could see many Bay&gt;Bae players utterly condemning the Bae&gt;Bay ones for being selfish. I feel they might not have realized that many chose Bae not out of selfishness but because of the above: nothing to do with who is chosen to be sacrificed but more with a different viewpoint about what's actually causing the havoc.    

In any case I absolutely loved the game and I think both endings were actually pretty okay, too. I can see why many were disappointed by them, especially the second one, but it was a tough call for the devs (like very often endings of great games are) and overall they lived up to it.   We need more games of this caliber!  
Thanks for reading....helps me to recover...    :/
/////////////////////
So I'm a huge fan of tabletop RPGs, and the idea of collaborative storytelling in general. However, much of my interest in tabletop is driven by my interest in scifi and fantasy, and in particular in building weird and inventive worlds. 

Life is strange is an amazing game, but as scifi it's not anything particularly special; time mechanics have been done a million times, and in more elaborate and interesting ways. This is not at all to knock LiS; it is first and foremost about the characters, and world-building through things such as its unique art style and excellent music selection. It takes the relatively straightforward and over-used time mechanic from scifi and uses it as a deconstruction of the adventure game genre, and as a powerful storytelling tool to invest you deeper into the characters and the world.

So when I ask "how can this be done in a tabletop rpg?", I'm not asking for system recommendations, nor am I asking for how to recreate Arcadia Bay, these specific characters, and this specific story, nor even the time mechanic. I'm asking, how do you make a tabletop RPG feel like LiS?

To avoid keeping this post from being too long I'll stop here, and in a new comment I'll provide some ideas, but I'd really like to hear all of your ideas!
/////////////////////
I finished this amazing game and chose to sacrifice the entire town for Chloe. My question is that whether the people in the town survived or were smart enough to escape? If they died I'm going to fall into a deep depression.
/////////////////////
I was just browsing through my games about to start my Mirror's Edge Catalyst. I realized that Max and Faith look very similar. Anyone else notice this and is there a fan theory about such a thing? 
/////////////////////
I just beat the game the other day, and I can't remember the last time a game (or any story for that matter) affected me so deeply. I tried telling everyone I know to play but I think only one friend bit, and after the first episode he wasn't really feeling it.

I dunno, it seems like this game has a pretty big following relatively speaking, so I imagine I'm not alone in this. How did you all feel after finishing?

Ever play Christine Love's "Don't take it personally babe, it just ain't your story"? It's been awhile since I played that, but I remember a part where the characters discuss fandom, and that feeling of not wanting to let go even though you know it's done and every attempt after to keep it going is just going to feel hollow, but nonetheless, here I am.
/////////////////////
Hey everyone! Not sure if this has been posted before but I started listening to a station on Google Play Music today that's based on the band Message To Bears (who have a song in Life Is Strange). I've been listening to it for an hour or 2 and so far it's already played 3 songs from Life Is Strange, and a lot of music that sounds very similar. Just thought I'd share for those of you who are as obsessed as I am with the music in LIS! ;)

Hi, i have been searching for some time but i can't find the person who's credit for creating the posters that we see in the game. I know that many of them have references to others things and found someone that sells some of them, but, i can't find the name of the person who made them, does anyone now?
/////////////////////
We know they started working on season 2. We don't know if we will have a game (could get stuck in developement hell) and when. But in the meantime, why not speculate ?

If you were in charge, what would you like to be different in LiS 2 ?
Make no mistake i liked Life is Strange a LOT but some stuff can always be improved.

Personaly, what i would like to be improved:
Different ergonomy. With a mouse, the click-and-drag stuff you have to do for most interactions isn't the best. And maybe my gear wasn't the best either but it was jumpy sometimes. I would like to be able to use the keyboard more, and the mouse less.

More streamlined story. 
The game indulge in mood whiplash and jumps from genre to genre, from sweet coming-of-age story and campus mystery, to full blown drama (was the euthanasy part really necessary ? It goes nowhere, has very little payoff) to thriller, to horror...

But without a solid worldbuilding to back it up: we are teased with interesting speculations about Max's powers, Rachel's ghost doe and the spirits animals, the real animals acting cray,  the Tobanga, and nothing gets resolved/explained. You don't need to explain magic, but there's a lot of thread left hanging and it makes the overall game feels a bit incoherent sometimes. The dream sequence also feels like it belongs in another game.

A different characterisation for the heroine:
Yes i would be happy with another female protagonist. But i found Max's characterisation at the beginning a bit too beige. She's a pretty waif, she's nice, shy, she wants to do the right thing and she second-guess herself a lot. And then she gets so many shit thrown at her she grows a level in badass. Reminded me of the new Lara Croft, and that means they took very little risk with this character. I hope the next protagonist has a more distinctive personality.



I loved the art direction, they don't need to change anything with that. A lot of people complained about the lip-sync failure but it wasn't that big of a deal. 

/////////////////////
If you go back at night to the shed by the train tracks you find the "rachel was here / Chloé was here" graffitis altered in different ways depending on wether or not you added your name.

Some people think it's Nathan, trying to atone for his mistakes in some convoluted way and warn you about Jefferson. But the handwriting doesn't match the ones he left in your room after trashing it.

So what do you think, is it Nathan, just more off his meds than usual so he is writing differently, or is it someone else ? And if so, who ?

/////////////////////
So as I understand it, when Max rewinds time, anything that is on her body at the time will be the same position (ie if she has keys on her, they will stay on her even if you rewind time). So the question here is, in Episode 1, when Max takes the picture of David harassing Kate, if you rewind time and choose to intervene, the photo no longer exists? If she took the picture prior, even if she rewinds, she should still have it on her right? 

And on that topic, how does the alternate timelines affect the outcome of the main timeline? For instance, if you don't kill Chloe in Ep 4, and kiss Warren before going back in time through Warren's selfie in Ep 5, even if you kissed Chloe in Ep 3 and chose every option that supported her, she still won't kiss you at the end of Ep 5 if you choose Bay ending. However, as far as the main timeline Chloe is concerned, you kissed her, and supported her throughout the game. Why won't she kiss you at the end? It's just a thought that occurred to me?
/////////////////////
We all know those moments: the parts that you had to rewind over and over because you fucked up somewhere, or those moments that were just so annoying you almost raged. What are some of those moments? Oh, and just so this doesn't become a complaint post, NO MENTIONING OF THE BOTTLE HUNT IN EPISODE 2. We all know how painful it was for 95% of us to clear.

Two moments that really gave me a migraine were the Jefferson Maze and trying to save Kate, with Nathan's cell phone key being a close third. Jefferson Maze was tedious AF and wayy too damn long. Saving Kate was so annoying because when I picked the correct option, she'll be like, "Oh, hey, you're right, maybe I should come down." and then when Max tells her to come with her, Kate's like "No, no one loves me!" Dude, I'm trying to save your ass here, could you please not be so indecisive?! I was half tempted to let her die (luckily I didn't). The Nathan cell phone key was annoying because the key isn't obvious (for those of you either stuck at that segment or haven't reached there, the number is one of the least expected numbers that you can find) and it took me multiple resets to work out. 


/////////////////////
You know what's one thing I really can't get? Why on earth does Max's power just disappear in the sequence with Kate? Game-wise, sure it makes the scene and trying to rescue Kate more intense, but story-wise it makes absolutely zero sense. It can't be exhausting her power because exhausting her power just results in her getting nosebleeds, passing out and getting migraines. So what explanation is there for this?
/////////////////////
-Potential Spoilers b/c I'm ranting a bit-




All I can say is wow. Wow. I haven't encountered a game that could captivate me quite like this one in a years. I have never had a game bring me to tears before, but the scenes with alt Chloe was just too much for my heart. The ending too. I haven't had a game leave me this emotionally distraught since maybe the mass effect games. I've never had this level of connectivity to the character I am, I felt what max felt, whether it behappy, sad, angry, excited, or just numb. I could relate with her on basic levels. I'm sorry for the shit post, but just bravo Square Enix, bravo

In [The Butterfly Effect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/) the main character can go back to a video's and mainly a piece of text's point in time by focusing on whichever it is. This immediately reminded me of how Max does the same with pictures. Does anyone know how much the movie influenced the game? If at all?
/////////////////////
Just finished it and I am emotionally drained and feel nauseous. I'm a 29 year old tattooed metal head and at first I thought I was playing some MTV game, but man....what an experience. I ended up so invested and felt so connected to the characters. I'm going to do another play thru for the achievements, but I for sure need a break to process all that. Awesome game. Really hope they make another.  Intense. 

Sorry if it's a lame post. Fuck your selfie.


/////////////////////
So I baought this game on Steam and wanted to try this game with the Steam Controller but I can't get it to work. I can launch it with the controller from big picture mode and even see my joystick and D-pad appear in the game when I use them, but I can't do anything ingame. Only mouse and keyboard works, nothing works with the controller. Anyone been ablet to make it work? And no, I DON'T have any other controller than the steam controller.
/////////////////////
Recently an old friend of mine passed away. We used to be very close, but I fell out of touch with him a few years ago. I've been in a pretty bad place since I heard the news but the lessons I learned from this game have honestly been helping me heal in a huge way.

LiS taught me to be good to my loved ones while they're still around. To reach out to them when I need them ([and when they need me](https://megadads.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/life_is_strange_episode2_kate2-pc-games.jpg)). And don't fall out of touch with them for no good reason. It's what happened to Max and Chloe and it happened with me and my friend as well. I always imagined that we would reconnect someday and pick up where we left off. I always thought we had time. Now there's no time, and I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. I feel like I missed out on years of fun and memories with him and honestly it haunts me.

Cherish and savor your good memories, learn from your mistakes, but don't live in the past or let guilt and regret eat away at you. You can't go back. You can only go forward. I can't see my friend again, or even say goodbye. But I can honor his memory by doing kick-ass things with my life because that's what he would want to see if he was still here.

I still miss him every day and it still hurts, but I feel like I'm more equipped to handle this grief than I would have been before LiS. 

Thank you DONTNOD.

This weekend I was making my YT, "2016 so far montage" and I re-found one of my favourite funny glitches from my time with the game.

Montage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srh7Ymm5A4U

Glitch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQqBALNRu8

This got me wondering, what's your funniest moment in the game? It can be a legit LOL moment, or a glitch!

/////////////////////
I decided to play this game for no reason other than I heard that it was good. Understatement of the fucking century. It's incredible. The writing is amazing. I became so attached to Max and Chloe.

I don't think I've ever been so affected by anything else like this game has affected me. I feel empty and broken. I feel like I actually lost someone close to me. I chose to sacrifice Chloe purely because of her own arguments. I sat there for 15 minutes debating. 

I regret it constantly. I actually miss Chloe. A fictional character. I feel like a piece of shit. Even if I go back and choose the bay ending, it doesn't feel real, because it wasn't my first choice. I'm just trying to fix my mistake. I wish I had chosen Chloe first. Maybe I wouldn't feel as godawful. It's made my depression even worse. Every time I hear Spanish Sahara I either start crying or have to quickly change the song so I don't start crying. 

Why am I like this. Why did I do that. 

**EDIT:** effected to affected
/////////////////////
How did you feel about David when it came to the interaction and relationship to Chloe? Some may point to how they may talk to each other. Others will point at just their general attitude. Then there is the more obvious that can give you a firmer opinion. Do you think that David mistreated Chloe.
/////////////////////
Life is Strange is one of my favourite games. I've been thinking a lot about how they could make a sequel that wouldn't tarnish the original game. Here are some of my thoughts:

**NEW SETTING, NEW STORY**

While it would be possible for a prequel in Arcadia Bay, it would be a risky move. I think the comfy yet creepy small town vibe of Life is Strange is what needs to stay. It's what made both LiS and Twin Peaks great.

I think a perfect setting for LiS2 would be the Midwest. A small town there with some houses like [this](https://65.media.tumblr.com/f49d41d9869b1430dacc1385825b874f/tumblr_o7xc4r4Qwr1s6r6ero1_1280.jpg). To change it up from the original LiS, it could be set in the 90s/early 00s. I think that would add to the secluded small town vibe. Throw some Modest Mouse and American Football on the soundtrack too please!

**CHARACTERS**

The characters in LiS are crucial to the world and the storytelling. LiS2 needs characters that are different to LiS, while still being just as likeable/unique.
  
**MORE OPEN TO EXPLORE**

I'm not talking about a GTA open world game. But it would be awesome to be able to explore the world, go almost anywhere at anytime. LiS was extremely linear, but I still had an awesome time playing slowly and exploring what I could. Imagine if you could wander around the town at leisure. Meeting new characters, doing side missions, getting completely lost in the world.

**CHOICES HAVE MORE IMPACT**

There were a lot of inconsequential choices in LiS. I'd like it if every choice had more weight to it. In Lis, the whole game came down to the final choice. The choices you make throughout the game should have multiple repercussions that lead down different paths to different endings. 

**OTHER THOUGHTS**

* I really liked the few puzzles, more of them please!
* Could be set a college this time
* The protagonist could have a different superpower (or no power?)
* I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NfnXdXpjL0) music video shows what LiS2 could be in the Midwest.


What feedback, ideas, suggestions do you guys have?
/////////////////////
Hello guys, I'm late to the party but I just started and also finished Life Is Strange and I really enjoyed the journey. It was so intense and so good, the ambiance, the relations, the twists. This is by far my favorite graphic story-telling/adventure game

I did also play the Walking Dead games in the same genre from Telltale Games and I remember there was there was this [graph for season 1 BEWARE SPOILERS](http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/the-walking-dead-graph-by-gamesbeat.jpg) (fan-made of course) which would let us see the impact of the important decisions that affected the story.

I did a quick search on this subreddit and besides 90% of the post being Fan Art which I can't seem to filter and I haven't been able to find this information

I will most likely play at least once more and change my replies to experience the game another time. I ended up this [Ending](#s "Arcadia Bay gets destroyed and I(Max) leave together with Chloe. After all I went through I was not going to let Chloe die to save this shitty town ruled by the Prescotts and their new construction project which I totally forgot the name. I do feel kind of sad that Max was not able to 'Go Ape' with Warren but I'll try to fix this is my new gameplay session ")

TL;DR :  Game is so damn good. Is there any graph that was made for all the decisions like this [one for Walking Dead S1](http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/the-walking-dead-graph-by-gamesbeat.jpg) but for Life is Strange? Can't find anything here, it's all Fan Art. Any way to filter it out?


Thanks for your replies
/////////////////////
An odd thought about the “sacrifice Chloe” ending of Life is Strange:  Max won’t remember any of it… until Friday?  Unless I’m missing something?

The “time-port into photo” mechanic seems to be:  Max goes to the time the photo was taken (into the body she had at the time), is able to act for a few minutes, then forgets everything (she said this to Chloe after she ported into the Warren photo), then once the time she left from rolls around again, remembers everything (both timelines - she remembered writing letters to Chloe in the William-alive timeline).

So… that’s weird.  Also means that in the “max wins Everyday Heroes” timeline, she texts David on day one, later forgets why, and then remembers.

It would perhaps be more tragic if the mechanic were different and Max didn’t regain her memories - then she’d forget having ever reunited with Chloe at all.  Also it would give an interesting twist to the mechanic in that Max would have to find ways to remind herself for later in those few minutes of action, like in the movie Memento.

It would also be interesting if the mechanic were different so that Max never lost her memories - so she experiences ages 13-18 two extra times (William alive, William dead again) - though, she’d probably be able to save Rachel in that case.

Also, for a while, my ‘head canon’ was that whenever Max used her time powers (rewind or photo port), the timeline she ‘left’ would just continue with a Max that had tried to use her powers and failed, which would better justify the ‘sacrifice arcadia bay’ option - arcadia bay would be destroyed in that timeline regardless. But then it occurred to me that from Max’s perspective this is effectively meaningless - whether the abandoned timeline continues or not makes no difference to any possible test or observation Max could conduct, so it is meaningless.  And so, it’s just like regular life, where it’s meaningless (for the same reason) to say that the timeline forks, and therefore a bad idea to, say, disregard ethics by assuming that you were going to do the ‘wrong thing’ in some universe anyway.  

Though at the same time I still feel that Max shouldn’t trash a timeline and then rewind on the assumption that the timeline she left ceases to exist.  But perhaps this is wrong?

Also, one slight annoyance: at no point is Max provided with any evidence whatsoever that she caused the storm.  Evidence would be something like “she notices the storm gets bigger every time she uses her powers”, not Warren’s “it seems reasonable from a narrative point of view”

And, though I suppose it would have been a narrative cop-out, it seems like in the final bathroom scene Max could have tried to intervene without time-powers.  Actually, this could be done even without a narrative cop-out - she tries to intervene, Chloe still dies in the struggle, and Max declines to use her rewind powers.  (Heck, it seems the whole thing could have been short-circuited with a cough when Nathan walked in.)

I bought Life is Strange through Steam for my friend's birthday but didn't realize it isn't available for Macs yet. Is there an easy way she can play it on her Mac or are we out of luck?

We found this link on the subreddit: http://www.easypctutorials.com/windows-steam-on-mac-wineskin/

But when trying to run the game inside Steam with Winetricks or Gamesformac all she gets is a white screen followed by a black screen followed by an error message that the video can't load.

We found this post where the user could use a wrapper to play it: https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3jd0dr/lis_on_a_mac/ but we had no luck. So it looks like it's possible but honestly we don't know what we're doing. We've never used wrappers before or any of these programs.

Neither of us are very experienced with Macs - is there something we're doing wrong? Or something else we could try?

She has a 2015 Macbook Air with Yosemite OSX (10.10).

Thanks!
/////////////////////
I wasn't too active on the game news, but now i saw some video and some article about they confirmed, so what is the truth?
/////////////////////
Now, some would argue that LIS is sort of a horror game with the emotional scarring that has occurred. Though, I'm hinting at is that is seems really obvious that DONTNOD does a tremendous job with environments and building these detailed worlds. There were various points throughout LIS that felt genuinely creepy and had me on edge. And of course you can't forget that one jumpscare that caught everyone off guard.
/////////////////////
Just got the limited edition for ps4 for under $20! So pumped! Been listening to the sound track so much! And I love the artbook! Can't wait for my second play through! Have it on steam and the ps4 now!
/////////////////////
Okay, I am 100% sure someone bragged about this before me but I am yet to put it differently. 
  
I finished the game in two days and when I got strucked with only two options I was a bit confused as to why Max couldn't set up the perfect timeline. Saving her and her dad from car crash is just part of a problem. The real issue here is that Max could have warned all residents of Arcadia Вау about the tornado thus saving everybody. 
  
And don't even start on 'but they wouldn't have believed her' crap because I think with Max'es power everything is possible. She could have proven her prophecy abilities to everyone and in case she wouldn't have wanted the publicity she could have come up with anonymous ways.   
  
At this point, the ending is logical only because it required some big drama finale. Now, I am not a hater. I enjoyed the game as much as everyone else here did, that ride on emotional train was something that I needed. It's just that I kinda thought about putting myself into Max situation and thinking that I could set up a perfect timeline without anyone getting hurt at the end. 
  
What do you think? I might not properly understand how her photo rewind works so maybe I am missing something, in which case please do explain
/////////////////////
I was watching a bunch of random older videos on YouTube and came across a few I hadn't watched in years, mainly interviews with Kate Moennig (played Shane on The L Word) from way back in 2008. This led me to a more recent interview from last year. In this recent video you can see she has the right sort of frame and body language for Chloe and tbh even facially she has the same sort of look. I think she's 5'8 so isn't too far off the mark for her physically.

Maybe if there was ever a live action film and they needed a grown up Chloe Price then she would be my first pick I think. Just give her some bright blue contact lenses and Chloe's tattoo and she'd be set.
/////////////////////
*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***


So, we know that in the alternate reality that "some prick" driving an SUV hit Chloe Price which paralyzed her. From the wiki "It is assumed that Chloe was gifted a car on her sixteenth birthday in 2010. At some point after that, she was hit from behind by an SUV and forced off the road." 

The only other person we know that drives an SUV is Nathan Prescott.
I believe that Nathan was the one that hit Chloe, and Nathan's parents would have probably covered it up.

TL;DR - I believe that Nathan Prescott drove the SUV that paralyzed Chloe Price. 


/////////////////////
Hey, guys, here is a theory for you. I’ve been thinking about this game since I started playing it. And one day I came up with an amazing idea that explained everything. So now, brace yourself! The revelation is coming.

 The thing is there was no real tornado. There were no rewind power and climate changes. Nobody broke into the school at night. Nobody found the Dark Room. There was just a girl called Max, who entered Blackwell Academy. A girl with a list of typical teenage problems. And one day, Max happened to be in the bathroom where she accidently became a witness of a murder. She saw the death of a girl with blue hear. And the dead girl turned out to be Max’s best friend. The friend that Max completely forgot about and never even tried to keep in touch. And then Max became overwhelmed with guilt, grief and helplessness. She hated herself for not keeping in touch with Chloe, for not being able to come out and protect her there in the bathroom.  “If only I could go back in time and change everything!” Max thought.  And then… She begins to do this.  In her mind, Max’s going back in time and saves Chloe. She imagines all those things that are never gonna happen, filling the emptiness in her chest.  She imagines herself some kind of superhero, “Super Max” who always saves her best friend. Her Chloe. But all those dreams cannot last forever. Because she knows what happened in real life. She saw Chloe dying, and her mind keeps saying her that. “Chloe is dead”  Keep saying her inner voices. “You can’t bear it. It’s more than you” . And then Max imagines the tornado, threatening to wipe out Arcadia Bay. And there is only one way to avoid the impending disaster. Chloe, who selflessly sacrifices herself in order to save the town. Chloe, who convinces Max that she can save all the people only by letting her best friend die. 

So in her mind Max lets Chloe die, accepting her death in the real world.  In this story, Max’s mind helps her to get through this tough moment of her life.
I hope you guys will appreciate this idea. Have a good one, and never forget about people you love. 

/////////////////////
Honestly, it took me a good 30 minutes trying to be sure if I'm framing this question right. Though, I think it a important one to discuss to some degree.

To give some background we all know Kate Marsh is quite a religious person. So much so that she had a reputation on campus which caused a number of students to mean towards. So, then at a Vortex Club party she is drugged, makes out with guys(possibly against own will), and recorded all while not truly aware of what happened. From there we all know what happened.

Now, if Kate was purely a victim of being bullied for beliefs. Without knowing all those other things that she had to endure. Would you the player have been as protective or caring towards her? Does the reason for her being bullied matter? If she was only bullied and mocked for being religious would you sympathize the same?

/////////////////////
Life Is Strange hit so close to home for me as a player. I was in my junior and senior year of high school when you released this game, actually just graduated today hurray for me, but this was a time where I could honestly relate to max. I was kinda lost with where i was going with life, was a loner art student, and going through some heavy drama and your game helped me through that but that's not even the reason I'm saying thank you. And it's not because this game hit me like an emotional semi truck and makes me break into tears everytime I think of the ending. No I'm saying it because your game inspired two characters that I began writing which in turn inspired me to want to become a director, Film director not game director I'll leave that to professionals like you. The music made by fans inspired me to write more for these two characters, and don't worry the only similarities the two have to Max and Chloe is that they are both girls and one is a loner at the beginning the rest gets kinda violent. Thank you all so much for making one of my favorite games of all time.
/////////////////////
I got the OST for Life is Strange and it's the perfect type of collection to play at work, the staff and customers respond well to it. Are there any other licensed soundtracks that you humans listen too that are as great as this one? Staying with the upbeat / indie vibe?
/////////////////////
Hey so I found the Media Kit Square Enix made on here and I really love the "I was eating this beans" and want to use it as a text tone, however Frank goes on to say "Are you fucking kidding me?" Would it be possible for someone to cut the sound file shorter so it doesn't include that part? Or of someone could explain how I could do it that would be awesome!
/////////////////////
Remember that weird equation scrawled on the table in the diner?  "x^n + y^n = z^n if n&gt;2."  If you look closely, the text lining the equation reads "I found a marvelous demonstration of this proportion but this table is too narrow to contain it."  I found this while revisiting the game and got a vibe that someone was trying to tell me something...  Turns out it's a reference to [Fermat's last theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem), which was a proof written by mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637 stating that there's no answer for pythagorean equation (x^n + y^n = z^n ) when n&gt;2.  Fermat was not able to fit the proof in the margin of the page of *Arithmetica* in which the claim is made, and the proof was not solved/rediscovered until 1994.  

I'm thinking this foreshadows the fact that Chloe's survival is mutually exclusive with the survival of the town.  As if there's *no answer* when n=2, or when Chloe and the town are both intact.  I realize that's a little different from n&gt;2 which is from Fermat's theorem, but I'm willing to grant them some artistic license to make their point.  That's just my naive interpretation, but I'd be interested if anyone else had a better idea!  

BTW: found the text by pausing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvNypQ8vw98) at 3:50
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
That's my question. How do you think other characters would react if they learned of Max's powers, and they were shown proof that it was 100% real, no joke.

It can be any character you can think of. Victoria, Warren, Kate, Nathan, Jefferson, anyone. How do you think they'd react.

I can only imagine what Kate's reaction would be. Her friend basically has god-like power over time. Who knows what that would do to her views and faith.

I do not want to think of how Jefferson would react.

So, what are your thoughts?
/////////////////////
I'm trying to do some research for my fanfic and wanted to have a roughly accurate geographical location to base things from.

I know Arcadia Bay as the town doesn't exist. The closest thing I could find, which is actually, to me, really damn close is:

Garibaldi, OR located in Tillamook County:
https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garibaldi,+OR/@45.5593572,-123.9200793,2447m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x54eb32b0d4f49977:0x71bc327c8223d60!8m2!3d45.5598266!4d-123.9109643

* http://www.visitgaribaldi.com

Especially some of the location's name therein and the overall arial view, looks like the devs modeled a great deal of Arcadia Bay from this.

It looks beautiful, I may have to make a pilgrimage there :)

Thoughts? :D
/////////////////////
The LiS soundtrack is really amazing and it's better when they are played in certain moments of the game. Which songs are your favourites, which moment were they in and why do you like it in the scenario?

Favourite for me is The Sense of Me. It was played in Episode 5 when Max is driving down to the Two Whales while Nathan's final text is played. The song adds to the already tense and emotional setting of the game and makes you really feel tense. 

So what are yours?
/////////////////////
I found out about yik yak a few days ago ; it got me wondering what it'd look like at blackwell academy , any ideas ?
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
So after beating the game, I went to YouTube and watched a few playthroughs and noticed that, even though these Let's Players made the same choices I did (for the most part), their episode five was far different from mine!

In my episode, Victoria wasn't with me when I awoke in the Dark Room! However, every video I watched had Victoria. I even watched my friend play when she came over and she had Victoria tied up with her!

I know some people might say I just didn't notice her but there's no way I could have missed her! Jefferson said nothing about killing her like he did in other videos, and I looked *all around that room* and there was no Victoria in sight.

Here's my major choices that may or may not have affected it

- I comforted Victoria after the paint thing
- I saved Kate
- I romanced Warren
- Victoria believed my warning
- When warning Victoria, when she said that she and Max couldn't be friends, I chose the "why not?" option.
- I befriended Victoria's posse
- I didn't injure Frank
- I defended Victoria to Kate in Episode 4

I've tried looking for other reasons but I honestly can't find one! Did my game glitch out or something?
/////////////////////
Don't be afraid to admit it as most of us are those people who weren't for LIS at first. Most of us were so reluctant that we literally waited until all episodes came out, watched a YT playthrough, found out about the limited edition, and then decided to finally get it...**on sale**.

What are some reason why you didn't want to play Life Is Strange at first?
/////////////////////
Dumb question, I know, but I'm just curious. LiS has a lot of characters and depending on your interactions with them, you either love them more and more or you hate them more and more. Just curious who are the guys you absolutely love and which ones you absolutely hate.

For like, my all time favourite character in LiS is Chloe. Not that I hate Max (she's my second favourite) but I feel Chloe is all around more developed. When we start off, Chloe is a brash, abrasive and sometimes really annoying character (screw you, bottles!). But as the game progresses, we see more and more of that character being a facade, and underneath it is a kind, caring, loving girl. She's been through tons of shit that no 13 year old should have had to go through, and her transformation actually makes sense. She brings out the best of Max, bringing Max out of her introvert, slightly unconfident self and giving her confidence. On top of that, she's extremely brave. In the final choice, Chloe, knowing that she had to die for the storm to subside, was willing to die, trying to persuade Max to let her go. How many of us would make that choice? 

Most hated goes to Mark Jefferson. It's a hard choice between him and Nathan Prescott, but Nathan at least as some redeemable qualities and in actual fact was just a pawn in Jefferson's game. But Jefferson has no values. He preys on unsuspecting teenage girls, drugs them and kills them, without even a hint of remorse. 

So that's mine! Who are yours and why?
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
And I'm really gonna miss Maxine. I feel like not only has this game gone in my top 5 of all time but so has Maxine as a character. Taking her on this strange trip and still making it out alive..

Which really surprised me. I keep thinking near the end with how much time was being changed that she was going to somehow die in a sacrificial way. Which ended up happening to Chloe. Which I did. It felt like the bigger picture decision but that didn't make it easy. 

I wanted so much for there to be a happy ending but I wasn't naive. I knew it was going to hurt and it did. Having to erase time with Chloe like that was painful. I wasn't that big on Chloe at first, but I really came to like the stark contrast between her and Maxine. 

I'm a little bummed at the route that was taken for Nathan. I was hoping around Episode 4 that there was going to be some sort of breakthrough with his character but it just got more and more tragic. Once the reveal came in that he was at fault for Rachel, I knew it wasn't happening. I'll savor that voicemail he left Maxine however. The one where he spoke about how everyone was using him and he was crying. Finally felt like Nathan was being real. And learning all the background info about the pressure he had all around him and the drugs and his adoration of Jefferson. I wanted to see more development with his character so I was disappointed he became sort of the scapegoat near the end of the game and faded into the background. 

I guess pretty much everyone did except Chloe and Max. Which makes sense, but I was hoping for a bit more closure I admit. 

I also felt a bit disappointed in how linear Ep 5 felt in comparison of the others. It made sense to me, but I felt like it lost a lot of the exposition I really enjoyed about the game. 

Aside from that though, I fucking love this game. I've been posting on here after finishing each episode and now I'm done and I'm off playing Witcher 3 expansions and throwing down in Dragon Age Inquisition but Life is Strange is one of the most unique games I've ever played. Not just because Autumn is my favorite season and a lot of this game rocks that aesthetic. Not just because I've always loved photography and all the pop culture like references in the game. 

I loved the characters. I loved how real things got. How it felt like it didn't hold back. I see a lot of people complain about the writing and the lingo in this game but it all made sense to me like I can't relate because I say "hella" all the time and I know people who also talk like they do in the game. The soundtrack and art styles and aesthetics and exposition. I loved it all really. 

DOES ANYONE ELSE FEEL THAT DOE IS RACHEL AMBER THOUGH? 

Like it's bugging me, haha. 

Anyway, I miss this game. I want a season 2. I want to play as Maxine again and learn more about her powers and the meaning behind it all and WHO THAT DOE IS. 

It's hard to discern emotion from text often but I feel melancholy like I pretty much feel the emotion the menu music evokes. I miss this game. Feels like one of those that has had a very big impact on me. 

How did each of you move on in your own ways?

Totally missed this on my first play through but wanted to share with you guys in case anyone else had missed it, enjoy! :D

Near the end of EP1 when Chloe and Max finish with the altercation with David in Chloe's bedroom they sneak out her bedroom window. When they walk up to the lighthouse you have time to roam around so I thought I'd easter egg hunt for a bit.

There is a small building you first see to the right as you walk up the path, looks like it has atmospheric gauges on top of it.

Walking around behind it I found some weird symbols or glyphs and Max makes the a comment about how she doesn't recognize them but they remind her of....wind.
Kinda gave me chills given what we know is coming and the significance. So I don't know if it has greater in game meaning (like Max leaving a clue for herself, a Native American curse, etc)

But I got lucky and found a thread on Steam's forum that outlines it, with picture.

It was a set of symbols borrowed from the novel: La Horde du Contrevent. The translated wiki is below:
&gt;"Things to note: 
1) in the novel, the characters are on a quest to stop an ever present and changing wind that is clearly magical in nature and often manifests cyclones. 

&gt;2) The characters struggle with not really knowing what they're fighting for and whether it's worth it, a sense of being lost which is reflected in Max and arguably Chloe and Rachel as well. 

&gt;3) The author apparently created a system of representing wind types using punctuation. which I think is part of why Max says the symbols remind her of the wind."

Ever since I finished the game I can't quite put into words what actually gives this game it's indie feeling. 

What makes Life is Strange both an **Indie &amp; AAA** title?
/////////////////////
Hi,
Anyone on youtube uploaded a life is strange video and gotten copywrite strikes 

Im unsure what do do since i have gotten all strikes from believe with all of the music from episode one

And i no longer want to upload because if i upload 3 of the episodes my channel will be taken down for copywrite strikes unless this is sorted out



/////////////////////
Today i finished my second play though of LiS and i took all the photos in the game and i just realized i didnt got the 'shutterbug' achievment (take all optional photos in Episode 4). So is there any solution to get this achievment now?
/////////////////////
When it comes to time, there's always gonna be unanswered questions and things that don't add up. What scenes make no sense to you? 

BTW I don't mean don't make sense as in why does this choice exist. I mean it as the events that take place shouldn't happen because xxxxxx. 

Personally I think the entire first half of Polarized in the Dark Room. A lot of things don't add up. For one, when we start, Max is tied up. She travels back in time to when Jefferson is still taking photos of her. In that scene, he makes it clear that he will kill her once he's done. Now, considering that we came from the future, why hasn't Jefferson already killed her? He's evidently finished taking pictures of her, so he should have offed her by now.

Second, why the hell is Victoria captured? He makes it clear that he considers Max his masterpiece. Victoria is unnecessary to his plans, so why bother leaving the Dark Room with Max alone in the room? He has no guarantee she can't escape, and he prizes her so much, so it makes absolutely no sense for him to leave her there alone to get Victoria. 

Third, a lot of the timeline makes no sense. From evidence in previous episodes, we can assume that when Max time travels through a photo and returns to the present, some time has passed, so she goes into the future (In Ep 3, when she returns for the first time, it's evening, but when she left it was afternoon. Similarly when she went back to fix everything it was evening, and when she returned it was morning.) So before Max goes back to the timeline where she won the Everyday Heroes contest, Victoria hadn't been captured, and in fact Jefferson was still taking pictures of her. So how is it that when Max finally returns to the original timeline and back in the Dark Room, Victoria is already dead? She hadn't even been captured and Max can't jump that far in time. Second, if David busts in when Jefferson is still in the room (which means before the beginning of the chapter) why is Max still tied up at the beginning? She should have been freed right, since David broke in? 

Look, the entire Dark Room part was done well in terms of story, but with all these plot holes, there is a lot to think about.
/////////////////////
As we all know that LIS grew more and more as the fans spread the word. I can tell you that I've personally told at least 5 irl friends and probably thousands more online. I am trying to ease it onto my parents and other family members. Have to admit that I may just aim it more for those around my age group. 

Though, one of the big questions people may ask is to describe it to them. Therefore, how would you describe the characters featured in LIS?
/////////////////////
We didn't get to meet rachel! :(

During the whole game anticipation was build up around rachel, hearing things about her from many different sources, leading me to believe we would finally get to meet her in some way at the ending. It felt like she was somehow connected to the whole time traveling and the effects of it and eventually we would find out how. When you hear she is missing for months everyone suspects the obvious and worst outcome: that is she is dead. And then you find out that she actually IS dead. You want her so much that be alive in some way so that chloe can finally reunite with her again. 

Then I accepted this turn of events. Finding out what happened to her did have a sad and shocking effect and that worked. I knew that the game would find some way to meet rachel after all. In another timeline, or in the past. And hopefully we could even save her. I thought that that was the whole point of the powers given to max: so that she can prevent rachel from dying. It would make sense. I kept excepting a plot twist involving rachel as the end grew nearer and nearer... and I kept thinking: no way are they not going to do something with her story. And then nothing happened with her anymore and the game was over. 
So, did anyone else feel disappointed over this like me? I haven't heard anyone else complaining about it. 

I think it would have made the game stronger. Now I don't get the meaning of everything that happened, going with the sacrificing chloe ending (the other ending makes even less sense to me meaning-wise). The only theory I have is that some higher power gave max this experience to help her cope with the inevitable death of chloe and letting her see what could have been, so she won't torture herself with the thought of: what if I could rewind what happened? 

There is even a point somewhere in the nightmare scene where max has a text message from rachel saying: I will see you soon, real soon. Or something similar. So disappointing when there was no follow-up to that apparently well thought out foreshadowing hint.
/////////////////////
Holy shit, was that an adventure. From the start to the end, it was an honour to travel with Max and Chloe. I have no regrets sacrificing Arcadia Bay for Chloe (BAE ALL THE WAY). 

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go cry in my bed right now. #fartoomanyfeels
/////////////////////
It's my second time playing and this time I wanted to try a different route. I stayed hidden in Chloe's closet and saw David hit her. It immediately pissed me off, but agreeing to stick to the new storyline, I didn't rewind. Then in episode two after I met with Joyce and told her that David had slapped Chloe, she all but flat out blames Chloe for him slapping her, saying that "Chloe pushes David". I used to like Joyce, but I will never understand a mother chosing her husband over their own fucking child. 

Did this bother anyone else?

Edited for spelling.
/////////////////////
Get the reference?
/////////////////////
Have yet to play Nightmare sequence in Ep 5. Honestly am afraid. The first four episodes had some feels, but nowhere near as intense as in EP 5. God, I'm so full of feels that I have no idea if I can make it through the end. And everyone is telling me the Nightmare sequence is horrible and more fucked up than anything else so far. 

I need fucking therapy man. Dontnod really messing with me here.
/////////////////////
Hey all.  I recently finished LiS on my Xbox One and felt so impacted by Max's story that I wanted to share it with a close friend of mine.

I bought a digital copy of the game on her Xbox 360 from my account along with the season pass.  She was able to successfully play through Episode One and absolutely loved it.  When she tries to continue, it prompts her to purchase the season pass or more episodes on her own account.  Is there a way around this since the season pass was purchased on my account?
/////////////////////
Ok, so it has been about a week now and can't get this game out of my head. Never have I played a game that has made me feel this way. The end was a gut punch on top of everything else. I genuinely feel depressed, I can't leave this world and it's characters behind.

I purchased this whilst it was on sale as a stop gap between other games. I needed something to keep me going before Uncharted 4 came out and then No Man's Sky after that. Something that I could pick up and put down easily. I play episode 1 and I'm hooked. 

Now I'm not one to cry at video games (or anything for that matter). I got a bit choked up at the end of Walking Dead Season 1, but only at Lee and Clem's farewell. I didn't care much for the other characters (except perhaps Kenny) and I certainly didn't think about the game after I was done with it. I couldn't stop thinking about Bioshock Infinite for weeks when it was done but it didn't leave me choking back tears every time it entered my mind. In fact, the last time I felt like this was about 10 years ago when I read His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman. It was at least two or three months before I started to get over that. There's a heart wrenching ending for you. I don't think anything else has evoked such an emotional response from me, until this came along.

Anyway, I chose to sacrifice Chloe and immediately regretted it. It seemed like the more morally sound ending. After watching the sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, I still think the SC option is the better ending. But I'm not convinced that I made the right choice and it's been eating at me ever since. I feel like I have lost some good friends. I really miss Max. I can't get this game out of my mind and think it is interfering with work and my day to day life.
 
So I've started a second play through and that seems to have helped a bit. I get the feeling I may be in for another rough ride. I've considered choosing opposing choices this time through but don't think I can late Kate die. I think I'll be more pro Chloe this time round and go for the SAB ending. I've got the special edition ordered mainly for the soundtrack, so I've got that to look forward to. And the podcasts and fan art are helping a lot.

Sorry for the long post, I feel I could go on. It just feels good to get it out. I don't have too many close friends in real life and I've always been a lurker when it comes to online discussion. I signed up to reddit just to post this. I haven't written my feelings down online since I was involved in some Final Fantasy forums about 15 years ago. I don't have anyone to discuss this with in real life. I'd love to get my girlfriend playing through this so that I can spectate, but she isn't really into games. She liked the Walking Dead but only got through the first episode before giving up. I haven't even been able to tell her that this game is the reason I've been down lately.

So yeah, I'm off to play some more now.
/////////////////////
Let me break it down for you. 

Chloe goes to the bathroom and meets with Nathan. There's an altercation, Max breaks and turns on the fire alarm. Chloe breaks free and runs away. That's all fine and good.

So, to Max. After leaving the bathroom, she talks to Principal Wells and David Madsen. Then she leaves the school. Assuming she doesn't talk to anyone else outside the school, she heads back to her dorm to get the flash drive for Warren. At the dorm, she has to get Victoria and her goonies out of the way by turning on the sprinklers and dropping paint on them. Then she talks to Victoria. She goes into the dorms, walks to her dorm, finds out the flash drive is with Dana, goes to Dana's room where Juliet has locked her out, talks to Juliet, goes to Victoria's room to find evidence, then go talk to Juliet, then go into Dana's room to get the flash drive. She goes out of the dorms, is forced to save Alyssa from a flying rugby ball, then go confront/watch the altercation between David and Kate, talk to Kate, and then go out to the parking lot to talk to Warren. She talks with him, Nathan comes up and starts threatening them, Warren and Nathan fight after Nathan attacks Max, and then, only then, does Chloe show up to leave? 

Look at the events that happened! So much time elapsed from everything. Don't you dare tell me that the whole thing was 5 minutes, because there is no way all those conversations are less than a second. Let's be kind, let's say 30 minutes elapsed from when Max and Chloe meet in the parking lot. First off, Chloe was expelled from Blackwell. There is no reason she should be hanging around there, especially since her step-douche is there. Second, she just had a gun pulled on her and almost got killed in the bathroom. The drug deal went bust, so what do people do in that situation? They get the hell out of there. There was absolutely no reason Chloe should have still been at Blackwell when Max got attacked. 

What do you guys think?
/////////////////////
SPOILERS FOR FULL GAME AHEAD!

Which moments got you so emotional or thinking WTF in this game? 

Played up till Episode 5, most emotional so far is still that whole scene where you can choose to kill alternate Chloe. The delivery and emotion in this scene no matter which option you pick makes you feel so damn guilty for whatever you picked. 

Most fucked up would be Victoria's death. Look, we all thought Victoria was a bitch at the beginning, but Episode 4's Vortex Party showed us that she had a nice side. It made me want to save her and so I warned her about the Dark Room. She believes me. Episode 5 comes around, I time travel through two photos and BAM! fucking Victoria is lying on the floor, drugged. Later, after we get back from tearing the winning photo, Victoria isn't there, and Jefferson just casually mentions that he killed her. WTF?! After all that effort I went through to save her sorry ass, she still gets killed? And just when I was warming up to her. Haven't played the Nightmare sequence yet (though from what little I've seen, it looks like it's gonna fuck me over so hard) 
/////////////////////
Often times we talk about how we would "do anything" to be able to have more time with someone we've "lost". With Life Is Strange we were faced with choices that seemed to question that premise. As a lot of other games seem to hang on this topic questioning morality and "the right thing". From a medium like LIS to reality. You have to ask the question of if love is worth the sacrifice?
/////////////////////
Just got to the Nightmare sequence, but fuck...this episode is really intense and emotional. I'm a wreck...Please tell me it doesn't get any worse.
/////////////////////
[A few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4lh8qw/ep4_spoilers_the_legality_of_a_certain_choice_in/) I asked about whether Max would go to prison for helping alt. Chloe commit suicide in episode 4. I wanted to share my conclusions from that discussion, as they reveal some interesting aspects of American law. I am not saying this to show that helping Chloe commit suicide is the “wrong” choice. For the record, I choose to end her life and believe it to be moral.

I should note that I have zero legal training and just have a mild interest in some law. Do not consider this post legal advice.

So, based on feedback from that post and some research I did afterwards, I have concluded she would go to jail if we make a few assumptions:

1. Max is unable to return to the original timeline using the photo OR another Max is left behind after “our Max” goes back. (either the original alt. Max or a continuation of “our Max”)
2. Alt. Mr. Jefferson doesn’t take Max to the Dark Room that week OR she does and survives.
3. The storm doesn’t hit Arcadia Bay OR Max and enough evidence survives the storm.
4. The police and prosecution are able to prove that Max killed Chloe. (I’d argue this is not definitive if William and Joyce are not pissed at Max. See the other thread for discussion of this issue)

In a discussion I read awhile back, someone thought Max is safe as euthanasia is legal in Oregon. She is not. [It is true that Oregon was the first U.S. state to legalize euthanasia in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ballot_Measure_16_\(1994\)) and remains legal today. However, the way a terminal patient ends his or her own life in Oregon is highly controlled under the law:

1.	The request must be confirmed by two witnesses, one of whom cannot be a family member, an heir, or a provider healthcare to the patient.
2.	A second physician must confirm the patient’s terminal illness.
3.	A doctor must confirm the patient is not suffering from a mental illness impairing their choice
4.	Either physician can reject their request if they have “concerns about the patient's ability to make an informed decision, or feel the patient's request may be motivated by depression or coercion”
5.	If approved, the patient must then wait 15 days and make the request again.
6. The doctor then fills a prescription for lethal drugs. Only a physician can assist in the patient’s death.

Of course, Chloe’s death fulfills none of these requirements. One could argue that it ought to be legal, but I understand why the law is the way it is. Without these legal requirements, a son tired of caring for his elderly, dying mother and hoping for her inheritance could kill her the way Max did. He could then claim she wanted to die, with as much proof as Max had. There is no reason Chloe could not have chosen to die the legal way, but she wanted to die after spending the day with Max. It’s a tough problem.

Now, assuming again that there was enough evidence, Max would be charged with [manslaughter in the second degree](http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/163.125), which in Oregon is the charge for when “a person intentionally causes or aids another person to commit suicide.” It is a class B felony.
If convicted, the judge would have to sentence her to a minimum of six years and three months. Judges are given discretion in sentencing, and given that she presumably has no record in the alternative timeline (unless for drugs or drinking in the Vortex Club) and that Max likely would garner sympathy for the situation, the judge may only sentence the absolute minimum. But this is one area where I am less sure, and it would depend on the judge.

The reason it has to be at least six years and three months is a controversial idea in American law: mandatory minimums. Another 1994 Oregon law, [Oregon Ballot Measure 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ballot_Measure_16_\(1994\)), requires mandatory sentencing for a number of crimes, including murder, rape, sodomy, and robbery. The minimum sentence for second-degree manslaughter is six years and three months. It was put into motion through pressure by Crime Victims United, a political group that pushes for “tough on crime” legislation. There was an attempt to repeal the law in 2000, but it failed.

Long before playing Life is Strange, I was not a fan of mandatory minimums, as they are usually pushed by politicians who want to look “tough on crime,” but end up preventing judges from having discretion in unique cases, particularly nonviolent drug crimes. Now I really don’t like them. What Max did should be illegal, but the judge ought to be able to have discretion in the case so that she wouldn’t have to go to prison. But instead, she would have to be in prison for at least six years and three months, and parole cannot apply to mandatory minimums.

Now, there are two ways I know of she might get away from prison. The Oregon governor could pardon or commute her sentence. She might also get less time through plea bargaining, but I know less about how that works.

In other words, I really hope there aren’t multiple timelines.

**Side note:** I had tried to find a fan fiction that explores this possibility, as it might be interesting to see Max with time powers in prison. But no luck. If anyone knows of one let me know. And before anyone asks, no I’m too busy and not talented to write fan fiction.

**Tldr:** With mandatory minimum sentencing, Max would have to serve at least six years and three months in prison if she was convicted of killing Chloe. She would not be eligible for parole for those six years and three months.

Special thanks to /u/Kevo-Malonis for finding some of these sources in the original thread!
/////////////////////
So naturally after finishing LiS through the first time I wanted more story, so fan fiction to the rescue.
I'm a Pricefield junkie so I found some really WELL done stories that captured the personalities. But sadly some just ended, no updates in awhile. Like the author stopped writing. So maybe RL and other crap probably got in the way.
I've started work on my own Pricefield story idea. For me though I've been looking for a way to start writing seriously for awhile. Loving these characters so much I figured it was a good place to test my talent (or lack thereof) and see if it's really for me. It feels scary AF because I'll be putting a big part of myself out there, but I want the criticism, good and bad so I can find my way through.

This all got me wondering:
Do you guys think a good chunk of the FanFict writers were using it as a kind of therapy and after awhile it kinda faded away, they "healed"?
Do you think they took one too many punches they didn't want to hear and just gave up?
Thoughts? :)
/////////////////////
As we all know from playing Life Is Strange. That there are a few choices where you think that by doing what is "right" or appealing. That somehow we are making things better overall when there may not be a "better". How has LIS made you reflect on the choices you've made in your life?
/////////////////////
This game really affected me in so many ways, just writing this now gives me Goosebumps.  
When talking or reading about the game I can recall every moment of this game and feel exactly how i felt playing it for the first time.  
There is no other game/video/music which makes me feel that way and I want to eternally thank DontNod for that experience.  

Anyone else feeling the same?
/////////////////////
When designing my revision timetable I came up with the 'ingenious' idea of using LiS for German Revision. I know crazy. My idea here - is that I play the game with German subtitles, choices, etc. I already started - but really blame my teacher who is always telling us the best way to revise for a language subject is exposure (I think he meant films, music videos, magazines, etc but this is better to me). The problem is that this only helps me revise for the reading... Oh well - I'll just have to use other sources for listening. Most enjoyable form of GCSE revision possible! If only LiS worked for all subjects.
/////////////////////
I love this game for so many reasons. There are so many characters to relate to and I just want to know which character is most relatable. I personally relate to Max the most. I feel so bad for Chloe and did everything I could to show her I was there for her. I couldn't let her die no matter the circumstances except for when she asks Max to kill her. I couldn't let her feel guilty for her parent's guilt anymore. Who did you relate to the most?

Edit: Just want to thank everyone thus far who has posted and throw a bit more details as to why I relate to Max that is a little less "Chloe" oriented.
I feel like Max is a huge empath (as am I) and that's why her relationship with Chloe really stands out to me. Aside from that, her inner monologue is very similar to mine. Self-judging, insecure, scared, sarcastic, observant. I feel like she is a very good main character that doesn't distract from the other characters of the game, but also isn't so flawed JUST so you will like the other characters in the game.
Well done DONTNOD. 
My new favorite game. Life Is Strange.
/////////////////////
I recently decided to listen to some Sparklehorse since Life is Strange got me curious about the artist when the song Piano Fire was played in episode one on Chloe's stereo, and again in episode 3.

However, what's especially interesting is not the song, but the album it's on: It's a Wonderful Life.

To quote Wikipedia about the 1946 film of the same name: 

"George Bailey, a man who has given up his dreams in order to help others, and whose imminent suicide on Christmas Eve brings about the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody. Clarence shows George all the lives he has touched and how different life in his community of Bedford Falls would be had he never been born."

Assuming one picks 'bay', Life is Strange is almost a distorted opposite of this film, in that it shows how changing things so that Chloe lives ultimately leads to chaos and other nastiness (or what have you; I think the mechanics of time travel and everything are damn unclear, despite my love of this game).  Do people think this is just a peculiar coincidence?  Or do you think it was actually intended by the developers?
/////////////////////
I thought I'd share my experience because it was so fucking intense.  It was after a friends birthday party, and we called it early, so I played from 11PM to 5AM.

I got this game two days ago and binged it heavy.  I was getting emotional throughout the whole thing, I mean, I couldn't save Kate, I purposefully killed Pompidou by throwing him into traffic, I went to the Dark Room and all.

However, nothing prepared me for the final chapter, 10x so because of alcohol.  I started at the very end of episode 4 in the junkyard, ending with Jefferson shooting Chloe in the head.  I saw it coming too late, and I was just sad and pissed so much more than if I was sober.  I slammed my fist into my desk so hard I actually hurt my forearm a little.  And the Dark Room, I actually felt like I was in some sort of horror film, I was genuinely terrified.

Of course, I fucking yelled when Davidson came in to save me, I was so happy I was wrong about him, and so sorry for everything.  I'm kind of ugly crying in my room now, the past few scenes were just so fucking intense.

Its like 3:30 AM now, and then the nightmare sequence came as I was starting to get off the peak.  At this point my mind is just blank, just creeped out and scared shitless.  I'm pretty sure I forgot I was Max Caulfield at one point and assumed this shit was happening to me.  And fucking, Jeffersons classroom freaked the shit out of me.  That note that reads "if you're reading this you're already DEAD, XOXO Jefferson", all the posters replaced with me, my fucking picture when I was drugged.  I actually screamed when He popped up behind me, and kept me back.

The ending though was too fucking much though.  After having gone through the constant torture that was Episode 5, going on this emotional roller coaster ride of not only the first 4 episodes, but while my emotions are running crazy from the alcohol, I couldn't sacrifice Chloe.  I also thought that maybe Jefferson wouldn't get caught if I saved sacrificed Chloe, but I couldn't let her go.  We went through too much, and I needed someone to confide in.  Who would console me if Chloe was dead?  She's the only one that understands.  

Its been a day, and I'm just drained from all that

Sorry its a long and maybe boring post, but I thought I'd share it anyway.

If ya want to ask me about any specifics about what I felt during a particular scene while drunk, ask.

TL;DR played last episode drunk, emotions ran wild, arms were injured, ugly tears ensued, Chloe was saved, now I'm extremely emotionally drained from this.
/////////////////////
So I know there are some posts talking about similar movies and TV shows to life is strange, but they seem to all focus on the aspect of time travel to change things, etc.
I was wondering if anyone knew some good movies or TV shows that have a similar feel to life is strange. ( Likely recent indie type movies or something ) 

By atmosphere I really mean the sense of their day to day live, interactions, the theme, the dramatic moments and how things are seen differently and mean much more than they do in real life. Kind of escaping the regular day to day life maybe? I'm sorry if I am bad at explaining this, just post similar movies or TV shows ( Theme, atmosphere, emotional, but not exactly related to super powers )
/////////////////////
Not as much of the time aspect, but more of the slice of life hipster aspect.
/////////////////////
I loved the soundtrack and want to try more from the same or new, artists. Just wondering if some of the soundtrack stuff differs from the artists' mainstream music. I've had some other OSTs where I love a song from a group but their style is different from the song on the ST. Has anyone else looked into the same groups from the ST below, any recommendations?
I need more of those LIS feels! ;)

I'm probably not the only one, but did anybody elses taste in music change? I personally listen to a lot more indie songs since I finished the game. 
/////////////////////
The "Mercy Scene", at least that's what I call it. When you are given the option to assist Chloe in dying.  After she finally exhales, I sat there for a minute taking it in and trying to hold other things in. All of a sudden Chloe's warm but slightly-sarcastic voice "Max, can you turn the page please? I can't cause I'm busy, obviously." 
Or something close to that, but she was already dead in-game. Needless to say it surprised the hell out of me. Also helped me cut the sorrow a bit because I couldn't help but laugh at the way she said it.
Anyone else have this? Game bug or scripted? 
/////////////////////
We all know those: those choices that no matter what, you're always gonna be heart-wrenched. What is/are the choice(s) that made you feel like that?

Personally, the only one I've done so far (played till Ep 4 end; just started 5) was the choice to euthanize Chloe. That whole scene was full of emotion, and when I chose to euthanize her, that whole part before she died almost me tear up. I later went to see the outcome of the other option, and seeing Chloe so mad like that made me hurt inside. 

Honourable mention to Chloe finding Rachel's body. That whole part where she's just crying animalistically was so painful to watch.
/////////////////////
What happens if you overdose paralysed Chloe when she asks? Has anyone done this playthrough? And can we finish the game while staying in this alternate reality, or are we forced to return to the original timeline?
/////////////////////
So I started reading 'looking for Alaska' which is a (really nice) book written by John Green. I fell in love with that book and I really think it's similar to LiS. I always imagined the school as the Blackwell Academy. Just everything in my imaginations was familiar to the game. 

Anyone else has the same feeling about the book and the game?
/////////////////////
Erased is a 12 episode anime  focusing on a 29-year-old  Manga artist who has the ability to rewind time and stop tragic accidents from happening,  and he eventually uses his powers to help him save a classmate from kidnap and murder. sound familiar? the show gave me serious life is strange vibes and I highly recommend it! if you're an anime  fan definitely check it out. I binged  the whole thing in one sitting. bonus is  that several times surrounding the time manipulation a blue butterfly shows up. a very interesting  coincidence...

I'm in the diner to get the keys and I talked to the cop, I got the option to rewind in the middle of the dialog, chose not to, but instead talked to cop about drugs. The game went all nuts on me, everything went blurry and the cop talked in super slowmotion. After he stopped talking, everything was still blurry, I rewinded and it went back to normal. The hell was that all about?
/////////////////////
As most of us know Chloe is a very complex character to work through at times. Especially, if you aren't really accustom to the various issues surrounded her once you get deep in the game. How we feel about her can vary greatly from those who think "she should get over it". To those who simply want to try and "protect" her and hopefully "guide" her in the right direction. With the various issues facing Chloe many of us simply don't really know how to handle it. Though, usually we always have someone we tend to blame.

*Has her home situation made the death of her father worst and caused further issues? Was having her friend leave something that made a bad situation was? Was Chloe just too "weak" to actually handle her problems? Does Rachel's involvement actually make things worst for her? Is there someone to blame?....Do we have to blame someone?*



/////////////////////

/////////////////////
Would Max have actually gone to prison had she stayed in the alternate timeline after killing Chloe? This seems to be a common sentiment, but from my estimation there are number of factors at play here.

For starters, it may depend on how William and Joyce react. If they aren't upset at Max for doing it, then it seems like it would be difficult for the law to prove either it was euthanasia or that Max did it. Would it be that hard to believe Chloe died from her injuries? I suppose a doctor could prove that she was overdosed, but there might be legal room to argue it was an accident. A doctor also may only look closely at her death if William and Joyce request an autopsy, though I'm not sure of the procedure here. Without that, the law may not have a reason to investigate.

Now if William and Joyce are pissed, then Max is probably going to jail, since then they would report her to the police.

There's also the matter of Oregon law regarding euthanasia. [A 1994 Oregon law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ballot_Measure_16_\(1994\)) gives doctors the right to end a patient's life if the patient has a terminal illness and requests it. However the law would probably not protect Max, as she is not a doctor, and the request must be witnessed by two people, at least one of whom cannot be a relative. Chloe's request wasn't even in writing, so Max's defense would rely solely on her word.

Anyone with legal knowledge (or just an opinion) have any idea if Max has room for a defense? How many years is she facing if not?

As a side question, anyone know of any fanfics that have explored the outcome of this choice? OTNB with time powers could be interesting. 
/////////////////////
Is there a Life is Strange Discord?
/////////////////////
Why hide the media? Most spoilers are text posts anyway, so they're not showing any thumbnail in case that's the reason. 

I just thought the subreddit would look more alive with them. 

Also, do you think it would be possible to make them look like Polaroids? I think that would look hella kool. 
/////////////////////
I just can't think of a good way to bring about the same themes and ideas again. Like how would they use time travel again? It was already shown that no matter what you do, bad shit will still happen. And if they did, how would they do the time jumps? Photographs were awesome and clever for Max, but if they did that again with a different character it would seem cheap. Do you think they'd introduce a different new strange power?

I would love a season 2, but how would they do it?

/////////////////////
This sort of a broad question that can go either way depending on how you take it. When it came to Kate there are bound to be people who simple don't like her because how religious she is. I guess that is funny considering in-game she was faced with similar issues with fellow students. At the same time others may have saw Kate's faith as refreshing. Then you have those who simply did not care.

What did you think about Kate's religious faith? Do you think it changed the story or influenced some viewpoints? Was it annoying to you? Did you simply not matter to you?
/////////////////////
Seriously fuck those bottles. Who else had trouble with them and had to Google the location?
/////////////////////
I tried searching before asking, but it didn't yield any useduk resukts that I could see. I bought the season pass and downloaded episode 2, but when I try to play the game it tells me I need tobdownload episode 2 to play it.
/////////////////////
I can scroll through the first page of this subreddit and find several posts similar to this one. And my God, this game deserves all the praise it gets.

I completed this game a week ago, and it's still resonating strongly in my mind. I spent all of last week playing this game. Monday through Friday, a new episode per day. It's like I would autopilot through work just to start up a new day in Arcadia Bay. And let me tell ya, Friday was a rough one.

You know that feeling you get after you watch the series finale of your favorite show? Better yet, you know that feeling you get when you say goodbye to your high school friends the summer before college? Because the moment you leave, everything changes.

I chose bae over bay because I would do anything for Chloe in that game without a second thought. It pained me when I had to call Kate or side with David. But after watching the "Sacrifice Chloe" ending, I knew that was the right one. And I couldn't stop watching it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I STILL can't stop thinking about it. It was just that beautiful.

I just can't seem to shake it off; it's all still running around in my mind on a constant loop. The characters, the storylines, the themes, the music--it's all perfect. I picked up the Limited Edition copy, and have been jamming out to the soundtrack for the last week and a half. It seriously makes life x10 better, no matter what you're doing.

I haven't played a game I loved this much since Portal 2 (and Life is Strange surpasses that). I haven't cared about fictional characters since the first time I read Perks of Being a Wallflower. I'll spend the rest of my life doing missionary work and spreading the word about this game.

It has been a hella awesome ride, Dontnod. Can't wait to see what you do with Season 2.

I bought all of LIS yesterday, thinking that it would just be a cute little game! The only things I had heard about it from my friends was just about how nice the music is, really. Simply put; I was terribly, terribly wrong. I had no idea shit would get real so fast. I can say I utterly adored the game and I did not expect the ending to go like that! Well, the very last decision was a bit obvious. Time travel shenanigans are my favorite after all. The entire time I fully thought Nathan would he operating alone. So yeah! Just a small squee before I drag myself to bed- though I'm probably going to go through half the posts on here. I'd love to hear what you guys thought the ending would be like!
TLDR; Good game, did not expect anything.
P.S.- Excuse any errors of any kind. It's 7 am here. I stayed up all night playing this game.
/////////////////////
A vast majority of the fandom really don't like Warren for one reason or the other. The most basic being because...well Chloe is life.

For those that started having a negative opinion on Warren. When did you stop liking him?
/////////////////////
Hey guys, so, I had an idea. On Tuesday, I will be receiving a Vive, and I've been hearing a lot about this Altspace thing, where you can visit or create your own room that people can join. I don't know much about it, but I know it's accessible from desktop as well as for people with a VR headset. If one doesn't already exist, I was thinking I could create a room for fans of Life is Strange. Would you guys be interested in something like that?
/////////////////////
Who did you choose to side with? I sided with David, because like Max says when you said with him, there is no real evidence that can be used against him. Having security cameras set up around his house is over the top, but that's not proof that he's involved with what was going on in the dark room. And if he did end up being the enemy, then for me that would be another reason to keep him around. Keep your friends close and your enemies even closer. That way we could have kept a closer eye on him, and possibly gotten more clues. And Chloe hated David, so she would do anything to throw him under the bus. Evidence or no evidence. It didn't matter to her if David was innocent or guilty. She just wanted him out of her life.

aka I'm back aka FUCK MR. JEFFERSON.

Dayummmm I thought the ratio of me posting my thoughts on Ep 2 from 3 was long but despite my being an introvert, life's certainly been busy lately. Plus I had been in this stage of loving the character of Max so much that I almost didn't wanna beat the game because it was like if I didn't beat it, there would always be new adventures with Max.

But I want to see this through. I also keep almost seeing spoilers on tumblr and other places and I'm like "GOTTA BEAT IT", haha.

Also so I can finally actually be an active member on her. That too :)

For those that haven't read my others and might be like what is this CHUMP, talking about (context is important right?) here's [Episode 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/46mv6p/just_finished_episode_1_no_spoilers_just_thoughts/), [Episode 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/47x574/ep2_spoilers_just_finished_episode_2/) and [Episode 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4cpjh0/ep3_spoilers_finished_episode_3/).

Picture me, cracking my knuckles.

Okay you can't picture me cause you haven't seen me, but picture someone cracking their knuckles cause they're about to do some good 'ol sassy online shit talkin. I GOT FEELS.

After how the last episode ended I didn't really know what to expect in regards if the new timeline was going to stick it through or if it'd be a temporary kind of tease.

On one hand I liked seeing William alive, but poor Chloe. Yet in this timeline they are both alive..

But on the other hand, the story that got me into the game in the first place was gone.

It was sad seeing Chloe in this position she was in but in some ways I felt worse for Max simply because of the guilt you can tell she's carrying. Like she's having this inner battle trying to decide which timeline was the "right" one.

Chloe having that line on the beach about not liking "hella" cracked me up though like you can tell this is still Chloe but a much more tame version. It was kind of adorable.

And she was so cute like the whole thing about the two of them watching Blade Runner and everything that went into that. Whenever Chloe smiled it was like lighting up a room. Such a different contrast from Blue Chloe (aka OG CHLOE) but it's sad at the same time because you feel for her in her condition. Like she's being so strong and she keeps repeating how grateful she is for Max spending time with her and it sort of breaks your heart. Because you can see how strong she is on the outside. She sort of radiates it. But you can tell deep down she's lonely, so sad and feels such guilt about costing her parents everything.

Which brings me to the first big decision. Chloe was like "yo fam put the x on my eyes" and let me tell you, sometimes in this game when those big decisions come up I've sat there and thought about it before picking a side. But I couldn't kill Chloe. I wanted her around. And even though she reveals she's slowly dying, I was hoping that in me keeping her around, I'd have some way to stop that you know?

I saw the mercy behind the request but I just couldn't bring myself to do that so it wasn't a decision I spent as much time on.


Sidenote: Although, like, what would you really do in that situation you know? I wouldn't ever want anyone in that bed or that chair but it's one of those parts in the game that really makes you look outside of the game too. It's part of what I love about Life is Strange.

Moving on, I quickly realize this timeline is only a temporary stay. And at first I'm like really? Because the twist of it coming in near the end of the last episode made me feel like I'd get to live in this scenario for more than what was beginning to feel like a prologue to the episode more than anything.

Yet again, I really wanted to get back to the OG (all about calling the first timeline original gangster right now) timeline because that was where my love for the game was in a sense.

I sort of took a moment to process what this meant. That William would have to essentially pass again. Which bummed me out because what I appreciate about this game is how interesting it can make the characters around you come across in such a short matter of time. I remember in the first episode that once I walked out of the school and started talking to everyone, that was when I knew I was in love with the game.

I really liked William in the short time I knew him. So I was gonna miss him. I was going to miss that he and Joyce were together too. Although I wish we could have gotten a scene with the two of them together. And even though I was going to see Chloe again, I felt like I was saying goodbye to a clone in a sense. So I had this other sense of attachment you know? Like I wanted both Chloe's around, even though they're one in the same? It's hard to explain.

So I go back and it was cute how Max is so happy to see Chloe be rebel Chloe again. Fiery and free. Not sad and restricted.

For a refresher since it's been a bit, I did save Kate so Chloe and I end up going to see her at the hospital.

WHICH MADE ME SO HAPPY. I figured with an event as big as this in the game, that her character would sort of be brushed under the rug for the rest of that game. Because I'm used to similar things happening in games like a twist will seem significant but in the end outside of some conversation options, things don't feel largely different. I'm looking at you Mass Effect.

But this was cool to me because I know that those who had a playthrough in which she did jump, don't get this scene at all. Which made this game instantly more replayable for me..

..even though I'll likely just youtube this stuff once I beat the game because my back-log is HUGE and I'm always wondering if I'll ever actually clear it out.

Answer: Probably not, haha. Too many games. Adulting. The struggle is real.

So yeah I see Kate which goes awesome because she seems Kate, but she's not sad anymore. She has so much love in every area of her life it seems and I'm so glad about this change for her because playing through this game as Max sort of made me adopt this paternal sense of friendship that Max had adopted for Kate. I wanted Kate to be happy. And I felt like I got to see that. It gave me peace of mind with her character. That if I didn't see her for the rest of the game and just received texts and such, that I'd be okay with that because I know she's okay.

Chloe and I go to the school and it was kind of neat seeing her there with everyone. I didn't notice it until I flew the drone around on the campus, but once I did, I see Chloe standing there chatting it up and everybody is doing their own things and for that moment it actually felt like Chloe as attending school there. Cool moment.

Anyway, we get into the boys dorm, Nathan's room-

-Oh yeah I totally regret not taking Warren up on his date offer since he's been so consistent in being a cool dude to her so I wrote that note on his board. Which was adorable. And it was also adorable when he text her that he would never take it off.

Back to it, Nathan's room is definitely creepy. But this part feels strange to me. Because as this episode progresses it seems more and more to paint Nathan as the sole antagonist in all of this. I feel like there's some kind of twist coming in this sense that they're setting me up to be naive with everything. It's beginning to concentrate on him so much but at the same time, you can tell he has some part to play in it. I also start getting the vibes that he's sot of a lost soul, caught up in a bigger picture of things.

Aside from the creepy art, his room was so aesthetically pleasing. Love the personality they have put into this game so much.

So I get the phone andddd that's when Nathan shows up. Naturally Warren's spidey-sense goes off and he starts throwing down. I kind of feel bad for Nathan at this point. I feel sympathy toward him because of how his Dad treats him, and that one email he had from his sister broke my heart in a way because she seemed like such a good person. One that he could benefit from the company since she understood how their Dad acted.

Basically, I could tell Nathan wasn't one dimensional. Not evil for the sake of evil. That sort of thing. But I also see how he acts.

I had Warren stop beating him. Then I went back and wanted to see how the other played out. Seeing Warren beat the shit out of him so much that he was crying just like..made me feel really grossed out and disgusted in a sad way for lack of a better word. I reversed again and went back to having Warren stop.

We go see Frank for info and this actually turned out into a really good conversation. Like it started heated but seeing Frank calm down and open up about Rachel was cool. As well as getting his help. Guess I picked the right options right?

Then we go back to Chloe's room. I put on some music and go Blue's Clues on the board trying to figure stuff out. No mail arrives and I realize this isn't Blue's Clues. I love when they sang that WE JUST GOT A LETTER jam.

I put all the info together and once I see that barn I'm like nooooo.

Like right here is when I picture Rachel hung inside there.

Which I was off about. But right here was when I started getting vibes that this Rachel plotline was coming to a conclusion and it was about to get dark.

We get there and I don't see Rachel hung and I'm like okay g
ood but this is still creepy. I see the chest right when they walk in the barn and I'm like it's locked and her body is in there but nope just notes. Then I notice the door to the lair and I'm like her body is down there and nope but wow..

I get down there and again it's making everything out to be as if it's Nathan and I'm sitting there as I'm exploring around wondering about the bigger picture. The motivations and such. I see the monitor with Kate's photo and I'm so thankful she's happier now but then I wonder if there's a chance to reveal this all to her and would I have Max tell her for peace of mind or go the ignorance is bliss route? It got me wondering.

Anyway I see the files and we get to Rachel and Chloe is freaking out but there's nothing concrete until I hear Max say the line "Why is he putting her in the ground like that?" or something similar. I'm like they buried her...omg..

In this moment I relate to Max. While it doesn't take away from what happened to Rachel, I like Max, didn't know her. But my friend did. You see Max sort of processing this and you know Rachel is dead but you see poor blue haired Chloe go into denial and it's just sad like you see Chloe start to run off and Max sort of look at her and you know Max knows and you know Max knows that Chloe knows. That this isn't going to end well.

Music starts playing. Chloe is driving like crazy. They get to the junkyard. And I admit, at one point when you're supposed to see Rachel in the ground I have no idea what it was I was looking at like was that supposed to be her in some kind of bodybag like I just could not tell.

But Chloe starts balling and hats off to the cast because I was crying through how convincing it was. That scene was tragic.
But then the camera pans out and you see that doe again. And I'm sitting there mentally like "..Rachel..?"

Which is followed by me processing her being there the whole game and I'm like fuckkk.

Sidenote: On a light note, I got SO confused about reversing time to bring the motor back up in the barn so I could tie the rope on it. I've never seen someone climb up and down in a barn so much. I burnt calories just watching.

Next scene is so quiet. Things feel calm. But calm in this calm before the storm way you know? Chloe is determined. I see the gun and I'm like does Max see that and if so how will this play out?

Then there's the eclipse WHICH IS SO COOL to me and again Chloe is just..in this trance. We get in and let me tell you, I personally really enjoy retro wave music and aesthetics and it's all over the opening of the End of the World Party scene. Easily one of the coolest parts of the game. You can FEEL the tension here throughout. Reminded me of the end of The Guest film.

I make my rounds and eventually speak to Victoria. I'm torn between warning her and not warning her. I figure I can reverse though right? So I warn her and that conversation went awesome and afterward I'm like okay I don't need to see the other one.

My naive ass.

We leave and Mr. Jefferson is all YO WAS GOOD and shortly after we get the text from Nathan.

Except y'all know it's not from Nathan.

We get over to the junkyard and Chloe's flippin her shit cause I'm running around with a flashlight looking for things to interact with. Annnd there's none to be found haha so I get to Chloe and it goes cutscene mode.

Once they confirm Rachel is still there immediately I'm like BEHIND YOU BEHIND YOU DOE.

Sure enough she gets the needle in the neck and even though I was questioning it being Nathan before, here I'm thinking it is. I'm buying into at least this part being him and him having baited them out.

Although I'm wondering in this short amount of time how he found out..

He shoots Chloe. I've seen that slow-mo shot of her on tumblr accidentally and I imagine this was something near the end game. But no, Chloe is shot and she's going down. But I'm actually okay because I feel like I'm gonna see her again like I just could not imagine her being completely absent from the last episode. Spoiler effect.

Close up of Max. Max looks up. And this is when my jaw dropped.
I could not believe it. Yet I could. But I didn't see it coming at all. There stands Mr. Jefferson. LOOKING over Max. End scene.

I'm literally yelling at the tv like aRe YoU fUcKiNg kIdDeN MeH?
I was pissed. Like, this dude, from the very beginning..like all this time...

Haha I feel so incoherent with words right now.

My mind just went in this state or process. I thought about how he was there at the very beginning. How my intuition was right about the Nathan arc. But then I wondered where did Nathan factor in. And what was Mr. Jefferson's motivations? Why was that him? What was his part?

I just sit there staring and thinking so much through and I'm like YUP JUMPING RIGHT INTO 5.

Which I did. Which I'm not gonna cover here because I wanna save it for one final impression ramble post of mine but WHAT an ending.

I started playing Episode 5 and got a bit into it. Not far, but enough that I hope to finish this one very soon because I'm sucked in to seeing how this plays out. I'm gonna miss Max but I'm ready to see this through. And you all have been so awesome toward me making these posts that I'd actually like to be social with everyone on here. I'm such a sloth. But just know I've appreciated the feedback from everyone SO SO much like it makes my day because everyone is so damn friendly and supportive and it's just great. I feel like a fly on the wall of this subreddit yet a part of it at the same time. Such a great community.

What were you're thoughts when you saw it was him though? I'm SO thirsty to hear what all of your impressions were.

And what's something you all have done once you beat the game to move on? Like what helped you get past the feels and withdrawals once there things were finished? I'm gonna be there soon and I wanna be prepared.

:)
/////////////////////
Saw that this game was on sale for $11.99 on PSN so I bought it. The PlayStore said it was the whole game, but once downloaded it, the game saidit was a trial..am I and idiot? Is there ssomething I am missing?
/////////////////////
So just got my oculus and grabbed virtual desktop. It has limited support for creating 3d environments to sit in while you use your desktop. Thinking about what the dream would be, it would probably be to sit in chole's bedroom or max's dorm room and use the PC's in there. Both rooms have so much character it would be pretty awesome. Maybe the diner too, franks trailer.... so many great locations.   

Started seeing some posts here about extracting the models, but I imagine it would be tricky to get the environments/textures out too and light them properly. 
/////////////////////
I have finished LiS today and this game destroyed my life. At the end when Max and Chloe was taking i dont wanted to listen this, i wanted to stop the time but  i was crying like little girl i could do nothing, i'm adult man and i never cried so hard. I have no idea what this game have that it makes people cry. Now when i stopped crying i'm thinking only about this game, i consider if i could make some better choices, how i could help Kate (dont say me that if i want to know i will google it). What i would do if i'm Max in real life. And much more things. I finished this game 1 hour ago and i have no idea what to do with my life. I hope i will forget this game tomorrow. I heard about game Beyond Two souls have you played this, can this game makes me cry like LiS, please tell me what games can give me so many emotions(i played all twd)

BTW sorry for my bad english, it's not my main language.
/////////////////////
I marked this as Ep5 spoilers but in reality it's the entire season.

Below is my take on how the characters changed, but I'd love to hear other opinions.

**Chloe**

I tried making different decisions this time around, I was pretty Pro-Chloe on my first play through.  Man, I freaking hate Chloe this time.  She is the biggest asshole if you don't do what she wants.  She bitches and moans about every anti-Chloe choice you make.

It's just so amazing how different my opinion on one of my favorite characters is.

**Jefferson**

This one bugged me a bit.  If you choose to blame Jefferson when Kate jumps, the dialogue between him and Victoria before you sneak into Blackwell is awkward.  Jefferson's lines have changed but Victoria's stay the same.  She's dreaming of running off to SF with him but he's not going.  Even after he tells her to her face that he won't be going, she still begs him and the conversation is just painful.  

**Victoria**

My first time around I tried to see the good in her.  This time, I'm simply brutal.  I don't have much commentary on it but much like Chloe, Victoria's character truly depends on how you treat her.

**David**

David is one of the truly thorough characters.  Aside from a few plot holes, like the whole "David follows those I follow" line in Nathan's file, he is and always has been a misguided hero.  He wants to help so much but he just can't let go of his detective work.  I really like the birthday card he wrote to Chloe when you're trying to break into his laptop.  
/////////////////////
I've played it a lot, seen many many people stream this game, I've watched a couple of let's plays on youtube...

I guess you could say I've seen the contents of this game a lot(and I still love it just as much by the way)

But my point with this post is that it's starting to show in real life. 
I just came back from a walk with my dog and I saw a deer looking at me. And my first reaction was "Rachel?" it's so weird and funny that my reaction would be that. Just wanted to share
/////////////////////
Looked on the store but don't seem to find it
/////////////////////
Immediate automatic gut reaction of "SHUT UP VICTORIA!" Oh no, I'm trapped Jefferson's photography class again! EDIT-sorry guys, I can't figure out how to add a flair on mobile...

I just read this from neogaf, all credit goes to user "qualitydisc"

"Got an email today inviting fans of Life is Strange in the Chicago area to participate in a focus group. Presumably this means that some sort of offshoot project (or project in a similar style) is in the works, right? I can't imagine they would be focus-testing a game that is already a year old (especially to a group of people who are already fans).

Sequel? Spinoff? Different game, similar style? Or maybe they just want feedback? Let's speculate!

The link just generates an email to that address, asking you to fill in the requested personal information."

Maybe Dontnod is preparing to make a season 2 in Chicago or East coast of murica? This is all speculation but man this is getting me hyped!! 

Sorry if this is already posted by another user. 




/////////////////////
Holy shit. This game really knocked me up. From the start, I had been extremely careful with my choices. Nothing could've prepared me for the payoff; the resulting events ended up crushing me. God, it was devastating to find out what you could've prevented once the threads became apparent.

It was at that point that I realized that I have never, ever been so emotionally invested in a game before. At some parts, I yearned for a friendship like Max and Chloe's: a friendship where you can be content by just spending hours laying in the afternoon sun doing nothing. I feel sad that I never had a friendship as close as theirs, and I probably never will.

I played through the first four episodes yesterday because the sucker for feels inside me kept on shouting 'More! More!' Everything about this game is perfect: the writing is flawless, the characters easily likable and admirable, and the atmosphere so intoxicating that it makes you develop an odd sense of nostalgia for the Pacific Northwest setting. You know that a work of fiction is a masterpiece once it comes to an end and that sadness kicks in as you wished you could've followed the characters on their journey in real life.

Also, confession: Is it normal to crush on a person who's just bundles of good voice acting and lines of code? Because I have one for Max. If I were in her shoes, I wouldn't even have survived the first episode. Heck, she's adorkable, smart, sees the good in everyone and, to quote Frank, "has a lot of balls." What's there not to like? She's my newest fictional hero and I only wish I was half the person she is.

I don't know what Episode 5 has in store for me (goddamn, the suspense), but one thing's for certain - Life is Strange is going to fucking tear me apart. I'm going to prepare a box of tissues, just in case. Wish me luck.

EDIT: Just finished Episode 5. Fuck this game. Seriously, fuck this game. I love it so much. Hella rad.

Today I finally finished game for second time (I wanted try some other choices and ending) and I really think this was the last time. I will not touch this game anymore in future, it's closed chapter for me. 

I find some new thinking compare to first time play:


David - this is (for me) best character in game. He try to help everybody (even in not good way), he cares on students, he really love Joyce and Chloe.

Nathan - I'm not sorry for this guy. Yes he had some mental problems, but for what he did, it's not an excuse. Hate him, and I'm truly glad that he gets what he deserve.
 
Principal - don't like him at start and don't like him at end. He's just corrupted man in charge.

And biggest things I realize - Sacrifice Chloe is the only one right choice. I know many of you want be agree (some days ago I will not agree too)  but she made a choice for you. At lighthouse she begs you to go back and let her die, because she knows that the only thing she can do right. (That she wants to decide about her life like in alt. universe) 
I don't think if you save her (and bay destroyed) she will life happily after. She will be in deep depression (in her place I will be too) and don't think she will can live with it. 
Beside that I choose sacrifice Bay (only because I sacrificed chloe at first time)  too see other ending, and it only  confirmed my previous opinion.
/////////////////////
I'm a little heartless so I think he deserved whatever came his way. Though, I'm not gonna lie that that message did make me tear up a little.
/////////////////////
I put Ep5 spoilers in the title because I can't remember which episode it's in. But I remember in Samuels little office/room he had some piece of cloth that looked like it belonged to a girl. Was this ever explained? Or was it a small thing to get people to think he may have something to do with Rachel?
/////////////////////
The person is not much of a gamer.
/////////////////////
It was really strange (ha) hearing it out of the game, especially since I was with my parents who haven't played the game. [Plus I'm currently working on compiling the complete soundtrack,](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4k3ti3/life_is_strange_complete_soundtrack_album_art_see/) so I just can't escape the music.

For those who don't remember, "Got Well Soon" is the first song you hear at the Vortex Club Party.

[If you want an audio reminder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NShTPAlRy4k)
/////////////////////
...I really, really hoped that it's an announcement for Season 2.
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
First of all I don't watch TV, I don't play games for the story. I play games for the multiplayer and the open world aspects. 

My friends recommend to me life is strange, I could never get into Telltale's games so I never gave life is strange a try, I always made the argument how could a game that you can experience once then shelv it be worth the full price tag?

I finally completed Life is Strange, it left me speechless and pretty sad. Maybe it hit too close to home,   I won't go into detail but ending episode 3 to the beginning of episode 4 I can relate to.

Life is Strange left me wanting more it was an experience that I don't think i can experience again emotionally. It was an experience I think will stick with me for a long time.

It is no doubt the best game I played this year. I hope there is more to come.

Edit: the soundtrack fit the game perfectly, it's normally not my taste or music, but I fell in love with the soundtrack, my favorite song being obstacles. I don't like taking anything personal but Life is Strange became very personal. I sort of wish I could rewind time to experience it all over again.
/////////////////////
Would it be wise of me to look forward to having a season 2? Has Dontnod said anything on the matter (they must be working on Vampyr as it seems)? Researching around has given me conflicting views, so, I have asked you guys. Temper your great expectations- or something to that effect, CD.

"***Max***! It's overflowing! What do I do?!"


"Well, seems like Super Max is still needed after all." Sighing, she tore her eyes away from her newest photo collage, and raised herself off the newest addition to the Price-Caulfield family home, a fashionable sectional Chloe had grabbed from her favourite flea market.


"Oh come on, Max!" The other girl had looked to her with a smile. "It's the perfect addition for the Junkpile!" Max still had to shake her head at their houses 'official' nickname. Yet for the price they got it at, she couldn't bring herself to disagree with it either.


"I don't know, Chloe..." Max replied. "Your last purchase from this 'flea' market took the first part of its name a bit *too* literally. It's been a month and everything *still* reeks of fumes"


"I know I know, but look at this one!" She scanned her wife's eyes for approval. "No stains, bugs or even cigarette burns! For 50 bucks we're practically stealing it!"


Being unable to say no to her partners goofy, beautiful grin, they welcomed their new family member to the Junkpile that day.


Lifting herself off of it, Max made her way to the kitchen. *I could've found it blindfolded if I wanted to. I'd only have to follow the smell of burning...*


Standing in the kitchen's doorway, Max watched her other half in full panic mode.
Turning around, Chloe saw her partner's grin. "What I am supposed to do?! It keeps making all these noises, and it even tried to jump out at me!"


"Chloe" Max said, hands outstretched. "Your mother is one of the best cooks I know, you work in a diner as well, so how the *hell* did you manage to burn water?"


She stopped and scratched her head. "I mean... you kinda said it," she replied. "My mom's a way better cook than me, David, or... William." Her voice caught. "There was no point to us cooking, because whatever we made would be crap compared to what Mom made."


"As for the diner, I only really take orders, they have cooks for all the rest." Smiling, her eyes met Max's. "And besides, like they could ever contain this beautiful blue mane in a hairnet. Why, the very thought of it is pure insanity!"


Barely suppressing a giggle, Max replied. "And you call me a geek."


Chloe walked over and wrapped her arms around Max's waist. "I suppose we can be geeks together then." She poked at her stomach, producing a squeal from the younger girl. "But it just so happens I know the hottest geek in town..."


"Oh no, don't you start that." Max said, wriggling in the blue-haired girl's arms. "The oven's still on, and besides, what about dinner?"


"Don't you worry about that, super Max, I turned it off while you over there giggling at my misfortune. Now then." She picked the smaller girl up and headed out of the kitchen. 

Dropping her on the couch, she got a squeak of protest as pictures of floral arrangements, a large cake, a man with a military cut beaming ear to ear alongside a blue-haired girl in a white tux, and that same girl standing next to a smaller, blushing brunette in a conservative white dress, both laughing at some forgotten joke, or maybe from just pure joy, all cascaded down to the ground.


Flustered and panting, Max stopped her wife. "Are you sure about this? I know you have quite the appetite."


She looked back down at her love's wide blue eyes. "You're not wrong there Mad Max, but I don't think just food can satisfy me tonight..."


Rain pattered down on the cheap shingles of their Seattle bungalow, and no more coherent words could be made out. But lying next to each other later in the night before their dreams took them, they silently agreed that they were as close to heaven as they ever needed to be.
/////////////////////
&gt; Damn look at all the easy but not so easy daily topics huh? Also, shouldn't we just be able to tag "spoilers" now since the game is out? Well, lets get right into the real daily topic!  


This doesn't have to be the one big choice you regret. It can easily be something that you just wish you would have did instead. For me it would be helping Warren get a better grade. This is mostly because right after I pretty much kept growing more annoyed of Warren and just wrote him out of existence.

jeez this soundtrack is so good.

I honestly would say that saving Chloe was the easiest. Though, to be honest I instinctively picked her in a microsecond. Later on I broke down to myself(and others) why I would still make that choice and why it was so easy. Besides that it would probably be rejecting Warren at every turn.

What choice was the easiest for you?
/////////////////////
Just finished Life Is Strange yesterday~~ a hella amazing ride of a game~~ However, I found Jefferson really hard to believe. His motives were kinda farfetched/overstretched and it seemed like the creators were trying too hard to make you hate him like HA HE'S THE VILLAIN. Maybe they didn't originally plan for him to be the main antagonist? I was really expecting more from the Prescotts, especially Nathan's father. Idk, what are your thoughts on Jefferson or overall?

/////////////////////
Obviously LiS draws a lot of inspiration from the Butterfly Effect and so forth. But whether it was intentional or not, what other stories were you reminded of during or after playing the game?

For me, one thing that I found myself thinking back to was, of all things, "Arn: The Knight Templar." That movie is about a Swedish noble, Arn Magnusson, who is unjustly separated from his fiance Cecilia and sent to fight in the crusades while she is sent to a nunnery. I saw it on TV several years ago, (I later learned it was two movies edited into one), and the desperation and anguish both Arn and Cecelia both go through over the course of the story to find their way back to eachother sort of reminded me of Max's endless quest to save Chloe (especially with the ending). 

The thing is, it's such a random reference to be reminded of that I figured it must be unintentional. But funnily enough, Max actually says a line in Episode 4 that sounds *almost* word for word from the end of the movie.

"I will never leave you again."

In fact, I almost felt like that one line can (in some ways) almost summarize the whole Pricefield relationship in the game, regardless of the ending. Depending on whether it's the BAE or BAY ending, it's either played straight or it's a cruel irony.

Another thing that I realized stood out to me afterward is also *probably* unintentional. The game occasionally makes references to Max being a superhero, and I suppose it's said that one of the themes of the game is that Max needs to grow up and realize she can't save people like in a comic book. But never the less I realized the conclusion still really reminded me of a superhero story.

Specifically, the final choice in general and the BAY ending in particular felt exactly like "The Man who has Everything." In which, Superman's mind is trapped in a perfect fantasy world by a Black Mercy, a telepathic plant attached to his chest by the alien warlord, Mongul. It can be removed, but anyone who has it removed experiences what the whatever they love being ripped away from them.

As I've said, one thing that kind of bothers me about the ending is that it seems kind of contrived to me, and deliberately crafted just to be vindictively painful to Max. I thought a fair bit about what that would do to her in either choice, but especially the the Bay ending.

As such, I often feel like the emotion of either Max confronting whatever forced her to make this choice or even my emotion as a player towards DONTNOD after finishing the game would be basically exactly the same as Superman's.


**Superman**: "Do you have *any* idea what you *did* to me?!"

**Mongul**: "I fashioned a prison that you couldn't leave without sacrificing your heart's desire. It must have been like tearing off your own arm."


The cartoon version, at least, even has Superman make the same promise to his fictional son that Max makes to Chloe.

"I promise you, I'll never forget."
/////////////////////
I already own a copy of the game, so I don't think I should buy the limited edition (even though it's awesome, I don't think I can justify repurchasing the game). Is there any way to get the soundtrack other than getting the limited edition?
/////////////////////
Take a shelter before you read... a storm is coming.


What if I told you that Chloe saved Max, before the lighthouse hit Max, and that we are just not aware of everything that happened? Did they both save each other, or maybe Chloe was the first who saved Max? Okay, I can feel some of you thinking I'm crazy right now, but let me explain. 

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, we 'visit' the lighthouse area 3 times during the tornado. (the very beginning of the game, the ending of EP1 and the final choice).

**#1** - We can see Max at the cliff as she [stands next to the bench](http://i.imgur.com/f8c9V38.jpg) and she's looking at the tornado. The boat hits the lighthouse, Max notices that and screams *"NO, NO!"*. Max cries for help?

**#2** - Max is already able to avoid falling trees, rocks etc. And the lighthouse that wanted to kill her, too. She's standing next to the same bench for the second time, and what now - [suddenly Chloe's hand grabes her shoulder](http://i.imgur.com/H20eLZ8.png). Right after that, the "vision" ends! Again. (Well, I don't think that it was just a "vision" actually.)

**#3** - It is very interesting, because at the very beginning of the final choice cutscene, Chloe is holding Max, [both of them fall on the ground,](http://i.imgur.com/X5pd0Jb.png) and Chloe asks *"Can you hear me? Please say something!"*, Max answers *"I must have passed out..."* and the part of the [lighthouse that fell down is missing](http://i.imgur.com/7tEbi4C.png), and there's also a hole in the ground, meaning that she avoided it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Let's merge these 3 scenes together**, like there was only 1, and see. In my opinion, this is what might have happened - Max is standing at the cliff next to the bench. When she's looking at the tornado and the boat it going to hit the lighthouse (first vision), Chloe grabs Max from behind (second vision) and saves her. But we are not aware what happened there, because Max blacks out, as always. Then, both of them fall on the ground, away from the area where the lighthouse hit, and this is the place where the final choice cutscene begins. Coinsidence? What if it's not, because it actually fits, doesn't it? Mind blown.

In addition, the scene at the cliff (where the lighthouse is about to kill Max) and the scene in the bathroom are kind of similar, because in the first Max [cries for help](http://i.imgur.com/AxKnPnV.png), and in the bathroom she [hits the fire alarm](http://i.imgur.com/Ct3NfXr.png). So you know, she did that in case of emergency. Also, Max said - ["We'd always be able to find each other in case of emergency."](http://i.imgur.com/Z3zNqTr.png)

&amp;nbsp;

Now prepare, because if what I'm gonna say right now is somewhat true... If she takes a step back, in other words, if she uses the butterfly photo. In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, Max "wakes up" [next to the bench](http://i.imgur.com/IuwoiYM.png), so this is the exact same [place where the lighthouse wanted to kill her...](http://i.imgur.com/f8c9V38.jpg) not the place where they were both safe standing with Chloe. You know what it can mean? What the heck, if that's true, it can mean that Max probably didn't avoid the lighthouse at the cliff in the storm reality, or I don't know... I'll just say that something bad might have happened there. Guys, just compare the scenes and places and guess by yourself. What if Max dies in the storm and Chloe in no-storm reality if she takes a step back? "Jane Doe" on Max's shirt tells something? Edit: I forgot - and [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/vmbspzP.png) picture, of course... If that means what I said before, I can't...

My friend Bùi Ngọc Phương explained Max's rewind time power:


The Lorentz transformation ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 ) preserve the spacetime interval between any two events. In normal conditions, due to the physical limitations, the object can not exceed the speed of light (c = 299,792,458 m/s), so when minus two Lorentz equation that represents the two state of the objects, experience will always be greater than or equal to zero. However, if we can bend spacetime by creating a huge gravitational force then in some frame of reference, an object can exceed the speed of light and makes the experimental equation negative effect, in other words that object has reverse time. Thus, Max may has bend spacetime to infinite and makes Lorentz equation of two events becomes 'non-causal '. And thereby reverse the events. In other words, reverse time.


In principle, The Lorentz transformation not allow us go back in time as then the rules of causation will be completely broken: everything will have no origin and no end, finally the structural of spacetime collapsed and everything will explode. But if we have the ability to bend space enough for the structural of spacetime to be broken in a range, then within that limit, time could go back without affecting the rest of the spacetime. Perhaps Max's ability is not simply rewind time, it's the ability to control molecular density freely and without limitation, through this Max learned to bend space by increasing the density molecule to infinity and thereby accidentally rewind time.

I recently purchased a VR headset, and naturally have been looking at games to get for it, while impatiently waiting for it to arrive, and I came across something that would allow you to play nonVR games in VR. One of the games it's compatible with is Life is Strange. LiS isn't a first person game, and assuming I purchase this software, there is no doubt I will try it with LiS, but I'm trying to figure out what that would potentially look like in a VR setting. 
/////////////////////
With the death of her husband and her remarrying while raising a daughter. Some would consider Joyce to be one hell of a person and a mom. Though, is she really that great of a mom at the end of the day? With the apparent issues Chloe suffered through after her dads death. To the apparent abuse Chloe receives from her step dad. Discuss why you think Joyce is/is not a good mom.

*Also I know what we may consider "good" is very subjective.*

I, like a lot of people on this sub, had quite intense emotions through playing LIS. To be honest, I loved the feeling of, well, having feelings and want to experience it more. What are some books, movies or other games that have had a similar impact on you? For me:

-book, 11/22/63 by Stephen King. Very similar themes as LIS about trying to do the right thing and the consequences that arise from this.

-movie, The Perks Of Being a Wallflower. For some reason this struck a cord with me too. 

It'd be interesting to get others thoughts  and experiences about other stories and characters that bring the feels.

Here's a little Life is Strange fan art. I used Acrylic paint on 12X16" canvas. I shipped it to DONTNOD's studio the other day, they said they would hang it in their office! :D Anyway, I hope you like it. I'm definitely not a professional, but I had fun painting this one.

Hello strangers, its been a while since I’ve posted here, but I am back with yet another LiS inspired song. 

&amp;nbsp;

I just wrapped up another play through, and I was especially moved by the “request for death” scene that starts off Ep4, and thought that it was the perfect inspiration for an emotional piece. 

&amp;nbsp;

As always thanks again to everyone who has checked out my [LiS inspired album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzdSepr9xKA&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLzJtNZQKmXCuJkUGbnAE2k_spBJwEE9jS)

Do any of you think Dontnod will announce any more life is strange or more LiS related stuff at E3 in the Square Enix booth? I really want some more of this game - we cannot live without it Dontnod (eagerly awaits E3 in hope of news).
/////////////////////
Like the title says, I just finished LiS and had a question. How much can you really alter the storyline based on choices? Like, there was... a rather severe event in one episode (I wanna say Ep. 2, when Kate committed suicide) that I figured I would have been able to prevent with the right choices leading up to it. However, toward the end of episode 5, the event was used in the story so much that I couldn't help but feel it was unavoidable. Can you really change any of the major events?

Also, holy crap this game was incredible. I could probably gush about it for a while, but I'm still processing what happened. I'm also extremely glad I didn't finally sit down and play it before all 5 episodes were out. I couldn't imagine finishing episode 3 or 4 and not being able to immediately continue to see what was next.

/////////////////////
We all know that Life Is Strange Season One featured the power of time travel. Do you think introducing this supernatural aspect is something they should continue in future games? Or do you think having that sort of aspect is something you could go without?
/////////////////////
Hey everyone :)

I feel this is going to be long. I finished Life is Strange a couple weeks ago and wow, I don’t think I have come across a game, (or a text for that matter) that is so emotionally engaging and moving. Finishing it and reflecting on it, is like thinking of an old friend. I listened to ‘Obstacles’ a few nights ago, and it provoked an intense sense of nostalgia (with rather moist eyes), which was peculiar given that I have only really played the game not that long ago. But dang it, it has really impacted me because how strongly some of the messages resonate with my life experience. 

The choices. Matpat did a video on Gametheory not too long ago (there is also a post on this page from a few nights ago) and I don’t think he really does justice to the game in some respects. The final choice, that between choosing either Arcadia Bay or Chloe is not a dichotomous decision between the emotional vs the utilitarian option. It’s rather (in my humble opinion) as I reckon, a choice between the realities you choose to live, the mundane yet non-contradictory reality where you let Nathan kill Chloe or the strange and contradictory reality of Maxine going through everything, and the world keeping record of it. It is a choice between memory and no memory (I can’t really get my point across, but you know what I am trying to say).

Every character is a person. They are so real. Everyone has their struggles. Kate, poor Kate, the things that she endured that torture that nobody was on your side, not even God (from her perspective) would have been horrible. Nathan (despite the shit has done) has to deal with his dad, his mental health and the fact that nobody truly likes him at all (except perhaps his sister). Warren, trying to fight the ascribed beta male association, dealing with all the bullying and trying to get the attention of a very interesting and beautiful person. And Chloe with her struggles. And David. And Joyce. Even the principle of Blackwell has his fair amount of stuff (and consequently the drinking).

Life is strange is a friend that I have lost, I cried when Max had to suffer the horrendous torture, I cried when she saw Chloe in the wheelchair. I cried when I first had to sacrifice Chloe and lost the entire sequence of events and then attended her funeral. Then I cried yet again when I sacrificed Arcadia Bay, and was in the ute with Chloe driving by the sunset. 

Arcadia bay was beautifully constructed in its simplicity, the sunsets, reminds me of my childhood where I lived on the other side of the Pacific. The ideas, the butterfly effect and the symbolism, magical. Loved the inspiration from The Catcher in the Rye (one of my favourite books) and Max's desire to do the right thing and save people and the shared innocence of powerful optimism (which thank god I revitalised).

I love this game, I kinda hope there are no more games like this so I can just have this as a pristine landmark text but deep down inside, I can’t wait for a LiS season 2. Plus, I would be awesome if they set the LiS in Australia :)

PS- I have a massive crush on Max and Kate (simultaneously, one could say it is superpositioning of the two states (see what I did there))

The sunset. With Obstacles playing in the background.

Max: H-Hi Joyce.

Joyce: Good to see you again Max.

Joyce: You've grown alot as far as I can tell. How was Seattle?

Max: It was cool I guess. It was fun but I missed you guys.

Max: You still look the same. Beautiful.

Joyce: Nice save.

*Joyce leaves*

Max: Well I can predict something that will happen.

Chloe: Frank is worst than my Step-Fuhrer. Almost.

Max: Didn't he know Rachel?

Chloe: Yeah. We both hung out together. One day she just disappeared though..we were both going to leave together.

Max: Rachel must have been a good friend. Especially after I left.

Chloe: Rachel was my everything...she was an angel.

Max: I'm sure she's living it up in LA.

Chloe: Can you go any faster!?!?

*Max appears to be in a trance but she successfully gets Chloe out of the tracks right before the Train zips past*

Chloe: Screw Rachel. You're my new angel. Ok maybe not but you just hella saved my life.

Max: I should get to class.

*Chloe pulls off*

*Max notices Warren and decides to talk to him*

Warren: Max! Just the lady i've been looking for.

Max: What you want to ask me on a date?

Warren: A-Anyway I need help with this science experiment.

Max: I'd be honored.

Warren: So Potassium or Chloride

Max: I don't know.

*Max looks over and sees a little can*

Max: What about that?

Warren: Borax?

Warren: I don't know but you are the scientist.

*Warren pours it into the beaker*

Warren: Cool! You are awesome Max!

*Ms.Grant passes by* 

Ms. Grant: Well Warren. It looks like you were able to figure it out. 

Ms. Grant: I'll grade it later.

*Brooke looks at the group*

Brooke: Hmph..so Warren doesn't like girls like me I guess...

*Max goes over to Brooke*

Max: Hey Brooke how come you didn't help Warren out back there?

Brooke: Why would I?

Max: You guys make a cute couple. You probably would've done a better job than me.

Brooke: Thanks Max.

*Max leaves and notices Kate storming out the classroom*

Max: Kate?
/////////////////////
The Kate suicide scene. I'm on my third playthrough where my main goal was to keep Kate alive because I got her killed in my previous two runthroughs. I stuck with it both times and played until the end, but this time, I was so keen on saving Kate that after I killed her a third time, I went back to that point and re-did it to save her before starting episode 3. The damn bible verses are what got me (on my second run, I didn't remember what I put the first time because it's been a few months).

/////////////////////
It can be from the licensed of the original soundtrack. I'm personally fond of 'On my side' by Andy Huckvale from the episode two trailer. 
/////////////////////
We all know that Life Is Strange season one took on a number of real life issues affecting people. Which issues do you expect or hope to be address in a season two?
/////////////////////
For me it was this episode where things started really ramping up in terms of the feels. And now it's 1 year old! Wow!
/////////////////////
After doing pretty much all "pro-Chloe" answers except answering the phone, I figured fuck it i'll just go for Warren, kissed him.  Then when I sacrificed Chloe she kissed Max too. So on the same file max kissed both. 

Was there some patch that made it easier or something? After reading I was under the impression that it was hard to romance Chloe at all. I don't know how rare it is but if anyone would want a save file to poke around I can upload it.

Max: Today has been a crazy week Chloe..

Chloe: You're tripping balls girl. The week just started Max! And since we have met for the first time in years I know the perfect place to get hella high!

Max: Yeah..

*Max and Chloe drive to the house*

Chloe: So tell me Mad Max, what have to been up to?

Max: Trust me you don't want to know..

/////////////////////
Everytime I see a scene with Max and Chloe doing something together, experiencing so many things I get the feeling that I wasted my youth. Well okay I am just 23 (I can hear the older ones groan already :D) but everytime I listen to Obstacles or remember this game I wanna lie with someone important on the bonnet of a car, looking at the sunset and just exist (this sounds so mushy). 

Maybe it's the probably unfounded fear that I'll never find someone that's so special to me like Chloe is for Max. They're the definition of soulmates - damn next to the word soulmate should be a picture of them in the dictionary!

Just wanted to know if someone can relate :)
/////////////////////
I finished E5 today, [spoiler begins ] I picked Arcadia bay and.... MAN that was some dramatic ending.

I have seen a lot of dramatic things in shows, movies and games, and usually the nearest I was ever to cry was that my eyes get a little more wet!

I F**** CRIED like a baby over this one! not the kind of silent cry, the snobs.. snobs.. kind! ( luckily nobody was home! ) 

I saw the chloe ending,it wasnt nearly as dramatic as picking arcadia bay in my opinion but it had a huge sense of guilt that its all your fault, you KILLED and destroyed all these ppl and their houses. the kind of guilt that one can barely deal with it.

no matter if you picked chloe or arcadia bay please tell me about your experience .

My cousin brought up to me a great discussion topic.. what would happen if you killed the butterfly and saved chloe? Does Max's power come from the butterfly so that would mean that she killed it.. then she wouldn't have those powers and both chloe and max would of died right? Would like to hear what you all think!

Hey guys it's been a while. I thought it'd be nice to interact with the community more and draw some requests again! 

[Here was the first post I did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3gh8zk/taking_some_art_requests/)

I'll try and do 3 - 5 requests. First come first serve!

/////////////////////
Decided to give the game a chance since Doom and Battleborn were out (what a difference in genre) and I'm so happy I did. Its one of the best games I've played in years.

The game unfortunately left me as a giant ball of emotion and made me read Fan Fic for the first time in my life. I'm glad I found this subreddit so I could finally talk about the game with somebody else.

I can't wait to post more in the coming days cause there's tons of parts in the game where I felt a deep feeling in my stomach as well as enjoyment.

One I would like to ask you guys about is [EP5 SPOILERS] (#s "When Nathan left you a voicemail apologizing while you were driving, it gave me a strange feeling that i couldn't describe") Did it hit you guys/gals the same way? What did you think or feel?

Thanks for letting me rant about the game. The community seems awesome!
/////////////////////
There are a wide variety of characters in Life Is Strange. One of the more common things is how most of us can relate to these characters or know people just like them. Which character(s) remind you of someone you know and why.
/////////////////////
I love it. My only issue with it is that it doesn't play the LiS menu music in the background.
/////////////////////
Never before in a game or any sort of story have I felt literally heartbroken until in Episode 4 you find Rachel's body. The pure amount of emotion in Chloe's voice, the gagging, hell even her lines. "I loved her so much!", "what kind of world does this. Who does this?!" The music in the background adds to it as well, giving it the ambience. Even the deer gives me feelings!


I don't really care about Rachel the person, I care that Chloe was so heartbroken. Ashley Burch did a fantastic job conveying the horrible emotion Chloe was going through. Just thinking back to a character I loved (as in I care for her and am attached, not romantically waifu in love) emotionally destroyed finding the dead body of her best friend/possibly semi lover just wrecks me every time I think about it. 


I can deal with every other emotional situation I've faced in the game (BAE&gt;Bay), but this one scene hits me in the feels every time I remotely think about it. 


Just wanted to get it off my chest. 
/////////////////////
I beat the game about a week ago, and like pretty much everyone on here, I still think about LiS daily. I've been depressed for about 5 years now and I think that being depressed for so long made me numb. My life wasn't really going anywhere and I was pretty lonely so after a while I just accepted it, I even made myself believe that being alone was a good a thing. I would always put on a stone cold face and act like I didn't care about anything and eventually I just accepted that this is how my life was and this is how it'll be. Kinda became complacent I guess.

Then I played LiS. Like a lot of you guys I connected with the characters on a really deep level, more so than any other characters in any other form of media. I was super immersed in the game and the atmosphere was amazing. I ended up marathoning it in about a day. I really enjoyed the game but it wasn't until a few hours later where everything really hit home. I felt extremely sad, not about the ending but about the fact that I had to leave this world behind. The game made me really regret my high school experience and it made me feel actual, real emotions. Something I haven't felt in a long time. But now that it's over I just feel really sad all the time, before playing the game my sadness was just this kind of constant fuzz in the back of my head, it was always there but I never really felt it. Now my sadness feels almost unbearable and it physically hurts. More than anything this game has made me realize that there are better things out there, it's made me want to get out there and connect with people and have cool experiences, it made me stop being content with my depressing life. However, I just don't know how to turn my whole life around like that and I don't know if I can form those deep connections or have those cool experiences. So right now I'm just kind of dwelling on this unique experience. Probably sounds stupid but because of this game, for a brief period of time I felt like I had the life I always wanted. (minus the supernatural shit) Chloe and Max are still in my heart and even though they're not real people, they're still some of the best friends ive ever had. 





**FUCK THAT WAS LONG.** Sorry, didn't mean to write that much. If you read it all thank you, if you didn't I don't blame you. What I'm trying to say is that the game really changed my outlook on life and unleashed all those emotions that I had locked away for so long, however it's kind of fucked with my head in the process. So sometimes I just wish I could go back and be complacent with my boring life because atleast that didn't hurt so much. 

How did the game affect you? Are these the ramblings of a mad man or can you relate? Do you regret playing it? What did you have for breakfast? Share some of your thoughts please.
/////////////////////
Other than the good story of course it's probably the world it's set in, the beautiful autumn colours, the great soundtrack ( seriously I have played many game with great soundtrack although really different [cough, God of War] but LiS soundtrack is so good. ) the feeling of being trap in that town like it's the only town that exist. the loneliness.  
  
I didn't want the game to end, that's why I waited like a week before playing episode after finishing episode 4. Finished it a few days ago and I pretty much have the same feeling you guys have/had " hurr, what to do now ? " I think the only other game that gave me this feeling was The Last of Us , I cared so much for the characters in TLOU, and even though I didn't care much for the characters in LiS other than Max ( and Chloe a bit mainly because Max cared about chloe. ) the game still has overall good character build-up to make you care, I think I'll replay the game just to see if I can save [](/s "Kate, she was the only student I cared about, I was mad when she jumped." )  
  
But the soundtrack, the soundtrack is what made me love the game as soon as I started it

Hi, all!

Does anyone know the process for voice actors to appear at conventions? Do the voice actors set up spaces for themselves, do they get invited by the con planners, etc.?

Hannah has expressed interest in appearing at cons, so it would be really dope if she could attend some to connect with LiS fans.

Hannah and Ashly doing a meet and greet or fan panel together would be so fun, too!

Where do you guys buy LIS merch? Redbubble has so sweet shirts I wanna get. Any other suggestions?

Recently, I've been having a plan to do a LiS fanfiction. The story takes place after EP5 Save Chloe ending. The idea is that Max isn't the only one with supernatural and unexplained powers. There are others like her, and they're all captured by a secret government organisazion. Max is forcibly recruited to help stop a rogue agent, and then shit really starts to go down. 

What do you guys think?
/////////////////////
What are some things about Life Is Strange you didn't realize when playing? It can be something about the characters, dialogue, or even some random connection you came across.
/////////////////////
This is something I've wondered since this game came out, really. I never found Max's response to be entirely... expected. How would someone-- anyone, really-- react to being able to manipulate time? What psychological and emotional effects would that have on someone, truly?

So... be honest. You gain the power. What do you do with it?
/////////////////////
I've been burning through House episodes during my finals study session, and I find that most of the featured songs on the show fits the LiS soundtrack very well. Delicate - Damien Rice and On My Side - Cory Chisel comes to mind.

Hello reddit,
I want to ask how to hide the typewriter symbol when the game is saving. Its a good warning to not turn off the game at this moment but I want to create a clip with a clear hud. Maybe someone knows how to hide it by changing an entry in the config file.

**4:40 PM**  
As soon as the door closed behind Chloe and Max Rachel let out a long weighted sigh, bringing her palms up to her forehead and forcefully shutting and covering her eyes with them as she laid on her back. It was a relief to be alone again, but it also meant that Chloe wasn't there to take her mind off of things. Though she didn't really want Chloe around for the time being.  
That entire situation felt wrong. Chloe being so much closer than she used to be and a completely unrelated new face poking her head into things she has no idea about. The memories rushing back in brought a few old feelings back. Mostly of what Chloe used to be without the dark room. It was actually terrifying to see the contrast between that and what she is now. Almost as if everything Rachel experienced in the last 5 years tried to find its way back into her head. The purest definition of overwhelming. Even though most of her focus was still on her time in the bunker, that didn't really help - her time in there felt like years, and the amount of things she's been through that made up the contrast she encountered was immense.  
And then there was her own behavior. *It's good that you're still friends. You didn't have to try to make up, but Chloe said you did anyway. I appreciate that.* As if her opinion matters. Did Max think it does? Regardless, she let herself act as if it does. That was wrong.  
  
Rachel didn't know what to do with herself. These thoughts weren't easily going away and only made her feel continuously distressed. Again she found herself thinking of how much easier it would be if she was in the bunker, where she wouldn't have to deal with any of this. She didn't care about having to serve or any of the mild inconveniences that life had. She knew how to avoid getting beaten. That life was pretty much fully figured out. This one is not.  
Eventually her hands were tired from being suspended as they were. She lowered them and rolled over to her left side, not without some pain. She did the one thing that often helped her feel safe - curled up into a fetal position and just layed, trying to draw from the comfort of her own body. It wasn't the most effective thing in the world, but after some time she did calm down a bit. For now laying like this still reminded her of the dark room, and her mind made the connection to its safety.  
  
**6:03 PM**  
After a while the sun was low enough to shine through the window onto the bed where Rachel was. She didn't sleep, but time alone along with the lack of things to remind her of any stressful topics was enough to make her feel calmer and better. She felt rested after laying around for so long. And somehow active. More so than she's used to.  
Her back could easily feel the warmth of the sun rays. It felt less weird as it was there for a while, but eventually it became somehow tempting - she realized that the sunset shouldn't be that far away at this point.  
Slowly Rachel rolled over to her other side, straightening her legs, though with a bit more pain than before - the painkillers were wearing off. The sun in the window indeed was getting closer to setting and already attained a small tint of orange, but looked like it would take an hour or so before it hides itself completely. The sight was rather surreal to her. She laid for a bit more, but it didn't feel like she was getting enough. She pushed herself up to sit on the side of the bed, sliding her legs off and giving the room a brief look just to confirm that no one was there to help her.  
With a sigh she proceeded to push herself off and carefully slid down to her right foot, then to her knees while holding onto the bed. Aside from mild pain, crawling wasn't a problem to her. Once she was by the window she used the sill to bring herself back to a standing position, free to enjoy the surreal view afterwards.  
  
Rachel didn't know how long exactly she stood there - it didn't feel like she perceived time at all, but in reality it was only 10 minutes later when the door opened and a nurse walked in to check on her. Naturally, it was a bit of a worrying sight to her, but she figured it would be a good situation for the introduction of a crutch into Rachel's life. Though the girl seemed a bit too weak to use it alone for now, so the nurse had to recommend having someone around whenever she decides to use it.  
The visit wasn't just about the crutch - it was also the time to give her painkillers and bring some info about her future in the hospital. They still weren't able to reach her parents, but a medical bill was not something she should worry about. And assuming the tests won't show anything more serious than the obvious, they'd only keep her there for a couple more days.  
Naturally, Rachel didn't really respond to any of this with anything other than weak nods and simple 'yes' and 'no'. It's not that her mind was as far away as it was this morning, but she either didn't care or didn't have the willpower to inquire and figure things out. And when the nurse said that there were still tests to be done, she didn't have any objections.  
The first doctor a wheelchair ride brought her to was a psychiatrist. She wasn't required to have a proper session - it was simply a small evaluation to assess the surface of her current state and to see if there's any serious damage. A 10 minute talk, where she mostly performed small tasks and answered questions surrounding her mental abilities rather than the things she experienced. It didn't even require much actual talking or elaborating on anything, and the only things that had a hint of relation to her experiences were the question whether she was okay with having her blood taken and the recommendation to have sessions with a psychologist in the future.  
The answer to the question about the blood was a yes and so the nurse with the wheelchair took her to another floor where this procedure was conducted. Though it didn't actually go smooth at all - after the finger and a couple of vials from the vein Rachel got close to passing out, causing a bit of fuss among the staff around. It was quite surprising to her as well - the last time she lacked blood was when she was shot and she was nowhere near passing out that time. Though the most alienating thing about it was the surge of care from everyone that was around at the time. For them it was actually hard to tell whether she was still going to pass out or not with how distant the situation made her seem. It was prevented, however, and instead of continuing they decided to take her back to her room for a bit to let her recuperate.  
  
**7: 17 PM**  
She was left alone in her room again, still feeling a bit lightheaded. Lucky for her, the sun was still outside and got as pink as it could - it was almost touching the horizon. She wanted to ask the nurse to raise the back of the bed so she could sit up and watch, but didn't really have the strength for it. Lucky again, the nurse returned with some food shortly after leaving. Not only did she raise the bed to let her eat, she also brought a journal from the waiting room, to which Rachel reacted with surprise and a little alienated 'thank you'. It was weird to receive so much care when it came to the most insignificant things. Yet... she felt like it's something she could eventually get used to.  
Ironically, it was one of the fashion journals she got to read in the dark room. Though she didn't get to finish it back then and spent her time on finishing it after watching the sunset. It was actually turning out quite well for her. For the first time after she got out she felt relatively satisfied.  
  
**8:24 PM**  
In about an hour the nurse returned with a wheelchair to take her back to get the last vial. It didn't go as bad this time and was actually pretty smooth as they were obviously more slow and careful with her than before, though a bit of lightheadedness did return. According to the nurse, if the tests turn out well then this was be the last time she had to do any kind of them.  
After about 20 minutes or so after leaving Rachel was back in her room, nodding goodbye to the nurse who promised to be back tomorrow with breakfast at the push of a button. She was alone again, but this time things were a bit different. She was so focused on re-experiencing the sun before that she didn't even think of the night sky, which she could easily now see through the window. Being September, it still had a hint of summer to it - something she always liked. She watched it for a while, getting tangled in her thoughts again as the time went on. It wasn't an unfamiliar process and this time was more welcome than usual due to finally being able to take it in at her own pace. Some of the memories were coming back, and it was nice, though her mind was usually returning to the times when she remembered them in the dark room rather than to the actual times when they happened. It didn't bother her, and actually was the safe way she wanted to approach it with. Chloe wasn't there to push. No one was here to forcefully put her in a struggling position. She was finally relaxing properly, like in the dark room alone. It felt safer now.  
She didn't feel like reading the journal again. This could have been the last glimpse of peace she'll get to experience, and she focused entirely on it. After almost 3 hours she finally drifted off to sleep.  
  
**7:12 AM**  
Rachel woke up slowly entirely by the desire of her own body. That, and the pain from breathing. She must have nonchalantly curled up at night to avoid some of it when the painkillers' effect wore off, but aside from that she felt relatively good. She rolled over to her back with a wince and a groan and looked around the room. Again, this wasn't the usual bunker. Though by now it didn't feel as unusual. The more time she spent here the more normal waking up and simply being here was feeling. She laid for a bit like this just to give herself time to wake up, but having to suffer the rib pain was annoying and frustrating her quickly. After a minute of searching she found the button the nurse was talking about yesterday and pushed it, hoping that she'd be here soon.  
It was a different nurse, but she too knew what to do. It wasn't long at all before she arrived and satisfied Rachel's meek request for prescribed painkillers, and even brought a complementary breakfast afterwards.  
And so things were looking rather nice again. Rachel was sitting up, leaning her back on the raised back of the bed. Somehow she found herself feeling more active than she's used to again. Maybe it was the fact that she was actually *seeing* the morning - the view outside and the natural light in the room, the smell and the general feel. It was a crazy difference from the usual still bunker, where she didn't even have any reference of time up until last week. But she didn't want to start feeling anxious or scared again, and decided not to think and analyze for now, starting to read the journal instead.

...what does "ready for a moshpit, shaka brah" mean? I'm from Poland, so I don't understand it, even with help Of uncle Google.
/////////////////////
I'm sorry but I don't know why but for some reason I just want to get rid of Warren. I never thought of myself as a Warren hater but as time has passed. I found myself not wanting him to even be near Max or talk about Chloe. 

What about you guys?
/////////////////////
To preface everything, LiS is a part of my top 3 favorite games, if not number one. But if I were to be honest, the whole Max and Chloe coupling doesn't do it for me. And judging from all the posts on this sub, I feel like I'm a resident in Minority Town -- population: me. So I guess my goal in making this post is to find out if I am truly alone, and if I am, to gain some insight as to why you guys think Max and Chloe are good together. 

Okay, so without further ado, here's why I don't like the famous PriceField couple:

1) Chloe is an asshole.

- We all kinda know it. Obviously, life wasn't just strange to Chloe, it was straight up destructive, so her being an asshole is definitely understandable, but in my opinion, isn't excusable. We all know how hard life is/can be, but I think we all have the responsibility to treat each other kindly no matter what. And I get that there are assholes who have lovable aspects to them; I know I personally have friends who come off as assholes, but when it comes down to it, are very genuine, caring people (in my mind, this is Victoria). The problem is, I didn't see much else from Chloe other than her being a bitter, self-absorbed cliche of a rebel. 

What do you guys think? Are there moments where Chloe shows genuine redemptive qualities that I'm just overlooking? I think the only person she's decent to is Max, and even then I'd argue that she has selfish motivations, which leads me to my next point.

2) I don't think there's any genuine romantic connection.

- Being a 24 year old straight male, the good ol' lesbian fantasy is alive and well, sure, but if I look deeper, I don't see any reasons why Max and Chloe are genuinely attracted on a level other than friendship. I mean, for one, Max didn't even give a crap about Chloe for how many years she was in Seattle. Max never even gives a good reason for this when Chloe first picks her up! And if Chloe never picked her up, what reasons do we have to believe that Max would ever bother to contact her?

- On the flip side, we do see Max and Chloe reunite and strengthen their bond, but they do so by looking for Rachel...who is Chloe's lover...see what I'm getting at? To me it's weird to think that Chloe could be genuinely interested in Max romantically while they're looking for Rachel. And even when they find out Rachel is dead, it seems like Chloe's fallback to Max would just be a band-aid solution to her broken heart. 

3) Lastly, I feel like Dontnod doesn't give us any other alternatives romantically. 

- Here's where I'll gladly hop on Chloe's rebel train. In a game that's supposedly about decisions, there wasn't much of a decision to be made romantically. It basically came down to the Cringe King himself (Warren) versus Chloe. And after Warren pulls his "Max, come here! *PuhhhhLEAAAASE!*" bit, was there ever a question on who people would rather go for? So in my effort to try and keep the game under my control as much as possible, I took the route of being single by choosing Bay over Bae and not kissing Warren or Chloe. 

I feel like there's more I could've added to my points if I went through the game looking for it, but I just wrote what stuck out to me most and I've already spent way more time than I intended. Some of you are probably going to hate me, but I don't know, I just couldn't see any good reasons for Max loving Chloe, so by extension I didn't love Chloe.

Thoughts?

Edit: Also, I hope everyone goes against the Reddit norm of downvoting things we disagree on. I already know most of you will disagree with me. The whole point of my post is to provoke discussion on what we all agree is a beautiful game. So I'm looking forward to hearing *why* you disagree. 

Edit 2: Apparently there's a lot more to Chloe that I remember. Looks like I'm due for another playthrough. 
/////////////////////
My life is now complete.  I have spent months at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and as of about an hour ago, finally gotten to play LiS on my Vive in 3D (w/ VorpX).  The prospect of that last one is the thing that finally sold me on getting a VR headset.  It is a VERY cool experience, and with no particular motion sickness trouble thus far.

It changes things a bit, I've found.  The whole scale of the game feels much smaller, almost like I'm playing in a diorama or dollhouse.  It's a strange sensation.  The depth of field seems to work rather well considering it was only intended to work from a 2D perspective.  The tornado looks MUCH more intimidating and it's a lot of fun to have a lighthouse land on your head.  Not sure yet if the scale thing makes the characters feel any more distant, or if everything will be more...... painful than normal later on because I'm "in" the scenes to a much greater degree.

I've played through twice before and watched MANY LPs during the grieving process earlier this year (it only took about four months to scar over), but I'm now noticing details in the environment that I never saw before.  Everything from "WOW, THESE TOILETS ARE SO REAL" to the archway at the school's front entrance that gives the year of construction.  Something about being able to actually move my head to, you know, move my head seems to encourage more sight seeing.

Also, the blue butterfly flew through my head and landed on my nose.  Am I doomed now?  Seems like a bad omen...

I feel a far stronger impulse than before to reach out and start pummeling certain characters now that they seem to be right in front of me.  We need Vive controller support so that I/Max can do this.

The cinematic scenes are the biggest weakness so far.  They mostly work, but when the characters get too close it causes you to go cross eyed (there may be a tweak for this).  Also, it is much more peculiar when the camera is mounted to the ceiling or sitting on a shelf.  When it gets bad you just have to close one eye for a few seconds.

The third person perspective itself isn't particularly disorienting, though Max can often end up a little closer than I'd like to the camera (more eye strain with close up stuff).  The camera moves on a little bit of a weird axis, but it's fine.  I setup a hotkey to enable 120 degree FoV to make things more comfortable. 'cause 90 just was NOT cutting it anymore.

The HUD needs tweaking, but mostly works right.  Text can be harder to read at times.  The journal screens are sometimes thrown off by the FoV I think.  The cellphone, for instance, doesn't even come close to properly lining up the text with the bubbles (still readable though).

It's not the first way I'd play the game, but it looks like a pretty awesome way to do a 2nd or 3rd play through.


**Caution - You can inadvertently jump scare yourself...  The wider FoV has weird effects.  People flash in and out of existence periodically for one thing, always off to the side where it would normally be off screen.  If you move your head at the wrong time, a Warren might suddenly be in your face.  Not a wildly common thing to have happen, but it did make me toss my mouse a ways.


tl;dr - Go get a Vive &amp; VorpX and play LiS.  EXPERIENCE AN EXTRA DIMENSION OF EMOTIONAL TRAUMA!!!
/////////////////////
Which ending do you guys think is the "right" ending, bae or bay? And I mean in terms of the plot and the messages the game gives throughout, not just whether you adore Chloe or hate her guts. Personally, I loved Chloe as a character, she was fun and well written, however I do believe she was meant to die in that bathroom that day, and as such the "right" ending is to let her die. What are your guys thoughts?
/////////////////////
I've been playing it, and I've felt a little Life is Strange kind of aesthetic within it. When you hover your cursor around objects it's very akin to Life is Strange in my opinion. 
/////////////////////
This game got me thinking. I know, a shock, but a specific question came to mind.
What real life wishes would make good game-play/game/story in the LiS universe?

Most games are some form of empowerment fantasy of people's wishes.
Want to be rich/powerful, play rpg's or whatever management simulator and become king of the world.
Want to be strong/tough, play action games. Pick up a rifle or an axe and hack, slash, blow up,... make your enemies bow.

Even LiS has that. “I can reverse time?!!! If something goes wrong I can reverse it and it will never happen? Muahahhahahaha!!! Nothing will stop me now!!! Kneel peasants.”
Now, they used it to tell a story about the human condition and a coming of age story and not an empowerment fantasy.

Since the game for me is not about time travel, and I think(hope) most of you agree, and I wouldn’t like it if they brought back Max or time travel in a new season. If there is a Season 2 what could be the new gimmick? The new “be careful what you wish for”?
Immortality? Mind reading? Seeing the future?...

I know some of them couldn’t quite fit in a choices based game, but some could.
Mind reading could kind of be cool. If you could come up to someone press a button and hear what he’s thinking. Would that change how you see that person? Would you treat them differently? How would you feel about this invasion of privacy?
Seeing the future could also be kind of neat, game-play wise. At any scene in the game you can see how the next scene is going to play out. If you don’t like what you see you try in the current scene to influence the next.

Thoughts? Ideas?

/////////////////////
Okay we all know this game that gives us the feeling 
"Nope there's never gonna be a game better than this" 
and of course I said this to myself about LiS but even after 7 months I am still saying it. This game changed something in me and I think most people can't relate to this (besides you of course!) 

Tell someone "Hey I played this game and I feel like a new person after it" you'll probably earn some weird looks. But who cares!

Long story short. 
This game was one of the best experiences I've ever made.

PS: Bae &gt; Bay
/////////////////////
I have recently started trying to place and find all the music in the game. There are, however, some tracks that allude me still. It can also be a challenge to determine the exact placement of a song, as many tracks sound somewhat similar to each other. Currently I am looking for the music file when Chloe gets stuck on the railroad track. If anyone knows where to find it, that would be awesome.

What would be more helpful in the long term though would be a way to display what audio tracks are currently playing to the HUD, or at least to log them. I've found plenty of guides to using console commands for screenshot taking, but no luck on logging sound files.

[I've tried a few of these commands, but no luck.](https://udn.epicgames.com/Three/ConsoleCommands.html#Audio Commands)

EDIT: And yes, I have at least gotten console commands to work, [following this guide.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3quja0/ep3_spoilers_complete_guide_to_life_is_strange/)

EDIT2: Thanks for pointing out "Timeless" to me guys. I've been using Człowiek Drzewo's soundtrack on YouTube, but he only had "Timeless" under episode 3.
/////////////////////
So I heard there's a fan game called "Love is Strange" based on the game Life is Strange. I was just wondering is it any good? I don't usually play fanmade games such is this but I was wondering is it good and what is it about.
/////////////////////
Far-fetched or not, just share your thoughts! We all don't know so there's no harm.

My personal theory and extremely far-fetched one is that Max is a developing Time-Lord. This theory is just there because of the presence of Amelia Pond, who is from the Doctor Who universe. Maybe she's watching out for another Time-Lord, hoping to step in and join Max? Why else would she, who has travelled through time on multiple occasions, be found in a sleepy town doing clerk work?
/////////////////////
Today's topic is which character in Life Is Strange would you want a DLC to further tell there story. 

For me I would want one on Stella. You can tell that she is really hard worker and it would be cool to see her life from before Blackwell to before the storm.

/////////////////////
This is a deleted scene from The Avengers. Is this Hannah Telle? Looks like her @2:00: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pov4qMSfg9w

I know some games like the WWE games, Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Black Desert online, etc let you create your own character. Have any of you seen any cool creations of any of the LiS characters?
/////////////////////
Hey, LIS really catched me. 3 month after i finished the game, i still think about it. Now i try to find something similiar, i already listened to all the tracks and LIS inspired songs (check out Koethekoethe)  and watched a lot of fanart... Do you have any suggestions for movies,books, games or series for a similiar experience?  

Thanks a lot,

 **Also, I am gonna be changing up the daily topics. Future topics will have the topic in the title along with the number we are on.**

/////////////////////
So i have question about Max past. We know that she was 13 years old when Wiliam took "his last picture", where she look like this: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-bII7RbDg68/maxresdefault.jpg

At same year she moved to Seattle, and five years (when she was 18yrs old) later she come back. When you play you find this picture - http://66.media.tumblr.com/231226fca0a9fdec14bcdef568bf7924/tumblr_inline_np88seHKmj1s8x54y_500.png

I Dont know but for me, in this photo Max doesnt look like 13yrs old, she looks older, like 15-16.

So how is that possible ? Its (for me) really confusing, because Max and Chloe said they wont seen each other for that five years.

So he has bought the directors cut for the xbox 1 and it installed the commentary and the first episode but wont let him play the rest. It says content not installed and links him to purchase it again. 
Any help would really really be awesome. Thanks guys.
/////////////////////
Context: I just finished my first playthrough last weekend (saw both endings) and I was thinking about the game when I had this thought.

I get that the storm was because of Max messing with time and using her powers to change the world around her and that's not ok because you can't just change stuff. Chloe was meant to die in that bathroom and the only way to change that was if Max used her powers and manipulated the situation. But because Chloe didn't die when she should've it messed up the universe and the way things were "supposed" to be. That's why she kept almost dying/actually dying from other things and Max had to keep saving her and ultimately storm, ending choice, etc. So point was don't mess with time, what has to happen has to happen and if you try to change that then you'll make everything worse.

But then what about Kate? Kate was meant to die on that roof (or on the ground, technically) and the only way to change that was if Max used her powers and manipulated the situation. But now it's ok? Why isn't there a second snow/eclipse/whales/2 moons/storm if you save Kate? (I wasn't able to save Kate in my playthrough, but I think it's a pretty safe assumption that even if I had there would only be one storm.) Why doesn't it mess up the universe if Kate doesn't die when she's "supposed" to? 

This goes even further-why isn't there still a storm in the bay ending? Even though this time Max let Chloe die, she still hella manipulated the situation using her powers. Because of the knowledge she gained messing around with time, ~~satan~~ Mr. Jefferson gets caught even though everything we'd learned previously told us that he was careful enough and smart enough to get away with it. Jefferson wasn't "meant" to get caught, but Max used her powers and made it so he did. But again, this time there's no snow/eclipse/whales/2 moons/storm as a result. By catching Jefferson, Max also saves Kate who now again doesn't die when she's "meant" to so add that to the list of things that Max has still changed in the bay ending. But Chloe's still the only one who has to be sacrificed?

tl;dr: Double standards, man.

I just found out about LiS and I'm already in love. I bought the limited edition version which is supposed to have 1-5. Just finished the first episode and tried to continue on but it tells me to go to the Xbox store to purchase it.

My sister and I were playing the game today, and game across the "FIRE WALK WITH ME" in the mirror at Two Whales. However, we were having trouble reading the text and after about 3 minutes all we could come up with was "FIREMAN WITH MILK." Needless to say, we were confused.
/////////////////////
Hi,

finished LiS two days ago, cried about a day and now I have a therory about what caused the storm. Not sure if this was already discussed but I didn´t find anything that comes to this exact conclusion.

Rachel's soul or spirit (seen as does) caused the storm (and the other anomalies that clearly show that this is a supernatural event) to take revenge.
Not only on Nathan but on the whole town that is owned by the Prescotts. It explains why the anomalies are really limited to Arcadia Bay, like the eclipse which is only seen in the town.
 
*Insert from a later post below: Rachel knows Nathan will kill Chloe, too. Both murder cases will be solved, justice will be served, exhumation, but Rachel is soooo angry about this outcome that she says: Frack it, you will not kill Chloe, too. I will use Max to save Chloe and destroy this Prescott abomination of a town!*

**I KNOW! There are some Rachels Revenge Theories around but I didn´t find this one and it seems to add up.**

How did she cause the storm: **She is burried at the junkyard and the junkyard is on sacred indian grounds!**
There are references in the game about sacred grounds in Arcadia Bay and the Prescotts. The Totem. **The only option to stop the storm is if Nathan is correctly sentenced for murdering Rachel.** That´s the key of the theory. It´s not enough if he is killed by Jefferson because then Jefferson will probably be wrongly sentenced for Rachel's murder. The murder case is not really solved. **That´s not real justice.** Furthermore it could be very important, that Rachel is exhumated in time.

Rachel is "pet sematary" in hardcore mode!

Rachel's soul or spirit sends out the storm vision to Max AND Nathan. That´s why he knows about the storm, too and Max has the vision at the very begining. She gives Max her powers to save Chloe, too.

So let´s go through the different timelines to back it up:

I´m using an altered summary by user "poqreslux" in an earlier thread to make it a bit easier for me. 

**No Powers Timeline**: Chloe dies, causing Nathan to be arrested and he probably confesses to have killed Rachel or the police finds out in time. He will be sentenced for her murder! Rachel will be exhumated. That kills the revenge storm! But it also kills Chloe and Rachel doesn´t want that so she gives Max the vision and her powers to save Chloe from Nathan and the storm.

**Powers Timeline**: Jefferson kills Nathan. No Justice. No exhumation in time.

**Alternate Timeline**: Chloe is paralyzed and dying a slow painful death. Rachel is not discovered. No justice. No exhumation in time.

**Everyday Heroes Timeline**: Max has Jefferson arrested, and we know that the Prescott are now being investigated BUT the newspaper in the plane clearly states that no one was killed by Nathan or Jefferson, something like "there were no further sexual or physical abuse on the victims". They somehow did not find Rachel (in time). No Justice. No exhumation in time.

**Post-Everyday Heroes Timeline**: Jefferson killed Nathan. No Justice. No exhumation in time.

**Ending Timeline**: That´s a bit tricky. I´m not sure when Nathan is killed by Jefferson but I assume it is done before the arrest him. No justice. No exhumation in time.

So that means....both endings are not what was supposed to happen. 

Scrificing Chloe is like the opposite what Rachel intended when she gave Max her powers.

Sacrificing Arcadia Bay is fine for Rachel. Nathan is already dead but it´s not about moral justice anymore, she just wants to destroy the Prescotts town aka Arcadia Bay. Probably her spirit even prefered Nathan to be alive and see his families' town destroyed (that´s why he also had the vision, not as a warning but as a bitter sweet teaser)

The question is: Is there a point in the game were Max would have been able to save the town and chloe? A part were they actually find Rachel and can link the murder to Nathan. I don´t want to think about that. That would be more than tragic!

Ah, btw: We see the Rachel does again after the Storm. They stand around like "my work here is done!"
Aaaaand Warrens theory would be wrong which makes the scene more believable.

So what do you think?
...and sorry for some incorrect English, I´m from Germany.

Best
Felix

Edit: There is, of course, the "Chloe's destiny is to die" discussion. Yep, that´s pretty obvious. Time seems to be trying to correct the events and that´s why max has the powers. If you sacrifice Arcadia Bay, Max will still have to rewind and rewind and rewind in the years afterwards to save chloe from new tries of the universe to kill her and correct the timeline.
/////////////////////
At this specific point in time I'm wondering if it was such a good idea to play LiS. In hindsight it's a game which makes you experience the loss of your best friend, which if something similar happened in your real life can be quite a traumatic experience, causing you to relive moments of your past over and over again, like max rewinding and experiencing them again -- and again.
Now I know that they do offer psychological help for people sufferring from issues after playing this game, but that's only after the trauma has already been experienced. Besides that, personally I don't feel comfortable at all explaining my feelings to someone I don't know in a chatbox or mail conversation in a language which is not my first language (after all, English class only teaches you basic stuff, not the complexity of explaining the entire spectrum of emotions in English). It only works for me if it's face to face contact with someone I trust and who speaks my native language. So that brings me to my point kinda.. should LiS more actively try to prevent people from playing it who might be hurt and scarred by it? Traditional media already do this a lot, in gaming culture it's kinda a new ground since the ratings systems only decide if kids should be banned from playing it, not so much focus is on how these games emotionally affect adults.

Hi everyone!

You may or may not have seen that I recently interviewed the voice of Kate, Dayeanne Hutton (https://filmgamesetc.com/2016/04/exclusive-interview-dayeanne-hutton-voicing-life-stranges-kate-acting-reality-games-community/).

Next, I'm speaking with script-writer Christian Divine. Let me know if you have any questions you'd like to ask him, be it LIS-related or not, and I'll incorporate some of the most interesting questions!

Thanks!
/////////////////////
I know this does not really have to see with Life is Strange, but I guess most of you will really enjoy this song. It quite fits with the game's universe.

Nothing more to be said. Hoping you will appreciate :)
/////////////////////
I've just completed the game (yes I know, I'm super late, I didn't know it was going to be this amazing) and I'm looking for other stuff with a similar feel.  Specifically that sort of, relatable slice-of-life stuff, with the friendship between two friends.  I guess I ship Max/Chloe if that matters (who doesn't?).

Whether this 'something else' is published books or web serials, a tv show/movie, or even another game I'm interested.
/////////////////////
I know that some of the choices you make in the game affect the overall story, but I was just wondering about the Text Messages that you receive. Will they always be the same every play through? Or do even those change?
/////////////////////
So I finally started watching Jeesica Jones (only first "pilot" so far) and It really remind me of Life Is Strange...

Al that super-power protagonist, missing girl, investigating, photographics etc etc..

What you think ? 
/////////////////////
Just a discussion topic, I was wondering why you all picked your flair, and the meaning behind it? I suppose I'll start with mine "Submit your photo, Max" To me, I picked this one because throughout the whole game, I was worried about not submitting my photo for most of it. Would love to know why you guys chose your flairs.


Edit: I can't figure out the spoiler tag for this subreddit so I just removed it, I am truly sorry if I ruined it for anyone who hasn't played yet and/or finished

I just wanted to put a discussion out there on Interactive Cinema games, and give some questions I have. I looked at the list of all of them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Interactive_movie_video_games). One of the main questions I have is why are there so few of these? I feel like there is definately a major market for these and when we see rehashed shooters and MOBA's I want more games like Life is Strange, Heavy Rain and Beyond 2 Souls. Is it that studios do not make enough money from these games to make many of these? It just feels very empty for me, with few of these games in exsistance.

Overall Recap of the questions I have:

1. Why are there so few of this genre of games?

2. Are there not many of these because game studios do not make much of a profit from it?

3. .. What do you all think about it? Would like to know how you feel!
/////////////////////
Been so long since I played this game, nd to this day I still think they could've picked a better title. What do you guys think?
/////////////////////
Hi guys, little moment I didnt use the Life is strange models, so 2 days ago I decided to play a bit with the model of Max and Chloe
i change a bit the skin and add new power control to Max
Test even a First person view haha :D

Hope you will like , if you have some idea leave comment ^^

What are some things concerning/related to LIS you didn't realize while playing?
/////////////////////
I am one to get games a little later then everyone else, and i just finished recently  with some questions. One of those is how did the vision of the tornado disaster show up in her mind before she helped chloe? Isnt the whole reason thst the storm is coming is because she altered time? So if she didnt alter anything yet, how could she of had visions of it? 
/////////////////////
Hello everyone!

This is my first time posting anything on reddit - so far I've been only reading (I'm just as shy as Max at the beggining of her journey through time). Additionally English isn't my native language, so please pardon any mistakes I made (but point them out without mercy, so I can avoid repeating them in the future). I decided to create my reddit's first topic ever, becouse something is not adding up in one of endings and I simply cannot stop thinking about it.

But first things first. I want to start by admitting how totally wonderful this game is. I hella love it. I even like all those parts of the plot that were not fully explained - they allow me to create my own explanations and keep me thinking about Life Is Strange long after finishing it. I have nothing against endings too. In my opinion both of them fit the game very well and carry important messages. Also both are beliveable (if you can call any time-travel story belivable). But still there is something bothering me about "sacrifice Chloe" ending.

The game makes very good job at showing how powerful is friendship (or love - Pricefield FTW!) between Max and Chloe. I cannot believe that Max would let Chloe die IF there was even the tiniest chance to save her AND citizens of Arcadia Bay. I would understand Max sacrificing Chloe for the greater good IF there was no other way to save people in the town. And here's the moment, when I explain, what exactly is not adding up in "sacrifice Chloe" ending.

The final scenes of Life Is Strange take place in a reality, where Jefferson never cought Max. This means he never burned her diary and during the last moments of the game, Max should have the diary with herself. It's hard for me to believe, that after everything she went through for Chloe, Max would give up and decide to let her best friend die, instead of going back in time via one of the pictures from the diary and trying to save both Chloe and people living in Arcadia Bay.

Is this really a scratch on a diamond, which, in my opinion, this game is - among not only other games, but pieces of art in general - or am I missing something here? What's your opinion? Am I right, or am I right?
/////////////////////
This theory wasn't brought up by me. It was raised by Dartigan on YouTube, but I don't think many caught on to it, and it does intrigue me somewhat. Essentially, it talks about what happens at the beginning at the game when Max goes back to rescue Chloe. In the original scene, when Chloe gets shot, Max comes out of hiding and shouts "No!", then rewinds time. However, assuming you chose to save Arcadia Bay, Max would go back and not save Chloe. In that scene, Max doesn't come out of her hiding place. The theory is that, in the original timeline when Max discovers her powers, assuming she didn't have those powers to begin with, it would mean that Nathan would know she was there and she witnessed his "crime", which would give Nathan some incentive to shoot her and make sure there were no witnesses. 

And maybe I'm overthinking this, but all the Pricefield moments could be seen as playing this up. A lot of the times, Max and Chloe are like, "We'll be together forever." and that kind of stuff. What if that was true, and they were to be together forever? In other words, if Chloe was supposed to die, then Max...might die with her. You know, to stay "forever together."

What do you guys think? (P.S: I just got an aneurysm thinking about it.)
/////////////////////
Which adventure/episodic games do you think would have turned out better if DONTNOD produced them and why?
/////////////////////
Sorta spoilers.  Not really though.  So in the movie, when we first see Peter Parker, he's listening to Left Hand Free, by alt-J. I was surprised to see the band pop up in the movie, and it gave me an idea for my headcanon. Peter is a Life is Strange fan. Seems to have the right aesthetic. I dunno, just a little idea of mine.
/////////////////////
Take any elements you want from either series - whether it be Chloe and Max shooting up alien races throughout the galaxy or Master Chief trying to deal with balancing his newfound time powers with his high school social life.
/////////////////////
I recently got two of my friends to play LiS together and it got me thinking. I wondered how/why my friends made the choices they made regardless of whether or not they were the same as my own. 
So I thought that I'd come here and ask you lovelies about any of the choices your friends made that were different from your own and any reasons they had that surprised you.
/////////////////////
Each player can make their own decisions, and the story progresses differently based on each player's choices. I really want to see conflict between two people when making the decisions, it could be utilized in a great way. Will you make a sacrifice to help the other player? Would they do the same for you? 

I'm torn between wanting local co-op, invite-only friend lists, or a random queue.
/////////////////////
Late to the party ! I wanted to play Life Is Strange for so long but felt the game was a bit expensive, I decided to wait for a sale, and finally it is currently at 9,99€ on the Europe Playstation Store. 

I played and finished 4 out of 5 episodes so far and the game is amazing, haven't liked a game this much since Telltale's The Walking Dead and The Last of Us. The soundtrack is simply incredible, mostly strings and relaxing, peaceful tracks. Bought the game a week ago and I like it so much I try to not finish too quickly.
I just hope the game has some replay value to it, it's often not the case with episodic and story-driven video games.  
  
I just really hope that doing different choices in another playthrough will impact the story a little or at least add some scenes and dialogues.  
I also get a bit of Twin Peaks vibe from it , I'm sure this is intentional as there is a reference of it in the Dinner's bathroom " Fire Walk With Me "
But what I really like about this game is the Art Style, Buch of Autumn colours
/////////////////////
Mine didn't show up for any of the episodes and I'm really curious as to what the most popular decisions were. If someone could post screenshots of them I'd be really grateful.
/////////////////////
Hey you, awesome LiS Community !


I have finished the game about three weeks ago, and still have a part of my mind stucked in Arcadia Bay. It's crazy how Dontnod managed to recreate this common period in contemporary life that teenage is. I mean, how can something give you flashbacks of moments you didn't even live IRL ? How can a game make you decide to change your everyday's life without even worrying about it ? One thing is sure, as many awesome people have said in this subred, life will never have the same taste again. This masterpiece of art is a real therapy for broken people.


Anyway, it's really refreshing to see the diversity of video games' communities. After my first playthrough was worried by my emotional involvement in the game, and really got warmed up to see that lots of people felt that way. As 25 yo dude, I put a knee on earth and swear to be more humble and grateful until the end of my life.


So now, let's go for the question : **do you have explanations, theories, or suppositions about Max's rewinding power ?** I guess there are many clues about it... What is the role of Tobanga in all of that ? The school is built on an old indian village, one of Stephen King's favorite "magic-inducer" ; is it linked with Max ? What about the animal symbolic (Chloe and the butterfly effect) ?


The development team already knows the truth, but let's try to get it by ourselves :) 
/////////////////////
What themes/topics from Life Is Strange made you feel uncomfortable?
/////////////////////
Sup community! Haven't been on here for like two months now(I still lurk around when I can) but anyway I was just wondering what some of you guys been up to lately.

P.s. I have come to the realization that listening to "Spanish Sahara" Is not easy to listen to(despite me listening to it well over 100 times...)
/////////////////////
Every time I try to check out a playlist someone made based on Life is Strange, it doesn't live up. It's ALWAYS either a really weird mix of songs from the game with shit like Lana Del Rey or Elle King that doesn't fit at all, or a ton of songs that are just straight up depressing. You know, indie songs that kinda fit but just...bum me out, or are so slow and boring I have to skip them.

Does anyone know of some really good music similar to music from the game? Or that has a feel in reference to the story? Stuff that's not depressing and actually kinda fits? Seriously just shuffled a playlist that started with Cat Stevens....like...why
/////////////////////
So I was Playing LIS the other day and I noticed that some of the character's names reflected their personality/role in the game e.g. Chloe's last name is Price which could be foreshadowing the price you have to pay for saving her, another example is Max's last name Caulfield which is a reference to Holden Caulfield which reflects her status as an outsider and the heroine of the story. Not sure if this is a thing or if I'm just over analyzing, but I thought it would be pretty cool to bring it up anyway.
Tl;DR Some character's names relate to their role in the story.
/////////////////////
As much as I can recall, these are all the "moments of calm" in the game. Please let me know if I missed anything. Thanks.

When we first met Chloe, I liked her, she seemed nice, but a little rude sometimes. But the more she spoke or did anything, the more I started to dislike her. I kept giving her second chances, since she was Max's best friend, but damn I absolutely hated her. Anyone else feel like this?
/////////////////////
So I completed LiS this past Sunday and my only thought of this game is that it is a masterpiece in how its crafted. How the characters evolve to the point you CARE for these fictional people I've had games do this to me. to make me care for characters but not on this scale the closest to come has to be TLoU, buteven though i saw it coming seeing as how Max's attachment to Chloe was already so strong and in the beginning and and then it grows stronger and vise versa with Chloe i had a good clue what was going to happen at the end but wasn't entirely sure and lets just say at least i got my bae but on a side note your decisions do matter even if they are just small consequences making something harder or easier or the actual death of one character but i was wondering something if Chloe was supposed to die was max gifted or cursed with the ability to alter time? In a since if its supposed to happen why was a person given the ability to undo it? and was the butterfly in the bathroom (Chloe's spirit animal) waiting for her to die so she could live on in it as we see if we save the bay ending or is it just me hoping for something like this i have my own opinions but let me know what you guns think
/////////////////////
Back from the grave again.

What were some things you thought critics got wrong about Life Is Strange?
/////////////////////
So I was watching a friend play through the game earlier, and he picked the sacrifice Chloe ending. He made a really good point when we got to the funeral in the cutscene - why was everybody from Blackwell there? Most of them never knew Chloe in that timeline. Any ideas?
/////////////////////
...to understand the "go fuck your selfie" joke. I am an idiot.

What are your moments where you missed the obvious or did not get the joke?
/////////////////////
Hey, new here. Been kinda lurking around but I just got this thought for how season 2 might play out, so I wanted to see how you guys would think of it.

Now, I know we're getting a new cast of characters for season 2 but I don't think, I could be wrong though, that we've gotten confirmation on a new protagonist. It could be that Max interacts with a new cast for season 2. Again, I don't know and I should definitely look it up.

But, what I wanna ask is, if Max doesn't return for season 2 and we get a new protagonist, how would you feel if they were younger than Max?

Not super young, I mean. Like, somewhere around the 11 to 13 range. How would you feel about that? What kind of story do you think could be told with a younger lead? Do you think the writers might turn down any darker elements the plot could have, or would they just leave it as it is, despite the player character being a child?

Anyway, what do you guys think about this? How would you react?

At episode one one her journal there is a bunny man looking creature, possibly referring to Donnie Darko? (Time travel) and the blue butterfly through out the episodes, possibly referring to the Butterfly Effect? (Time travel)

Just a thought :) please no spoilers I'm only on second season.
/////////////////////
It's fucking weird... It's not birds, and if it's leaves, it's a very odd effect. I'll post a video along with it if it's required.
/////////////////////
So long story short, I attempted to go through the whole game and make all the worst, immoral, selfish and hypocritical decisions I could make, partly because of genuine curiosity to see how things would go and also because I figured it would make for an entertaining [Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLct-6Z8cF99WMKuNTomq_hU8Qop1CDSf4). But what I didn't expect was just how difficult it would be to make some of those decisions, so I think that's a testament to how much this game makes you care about the characters and the story. They're more than just pieces in a puzzle. They're living characters that you genuinely want to see come out okay in the end. 

So, yeah, those are my thoughts on things after going through and trying to be the biggest asshole I could be. I'm curious if anyone here tried going this route on a playthrough and you found yourself struggling to make certain decisions or go down certain paths. But if nothing else, it definitely allowed for a new perspective on the characters the events of the game. If you can stomach some of the awful things you end up doing, I'd recommend trying this sort of run. 
/////////////////////
I've considered getting one, what it would be, I'm not so sure. This though has had such a deep feel for me, I'd like to have a tattoo. Maybe the camera, or the butterfly..... 
/////////////////////
Hello. I want to know, which moment in game is your happiest moment?
Mine is in Episode 4, after scene, where you can kill Chloe or save. That moment, when Max coming baack to normal reality, when she saw Chloe sit on the chair and she hug her from back. And in the background the song was played: "In my mind". I was really happy and I cry a lot, when I saw that scene :')
/////////////////////
Only app I have ever used for ringtones was Zedge, but it has a very slim selection. Does anyone know if I can get the theme song as a ringtone and how?
/////////////////////
I use to only listen to pop, rock, and a few other genres,  but now I'm finding myself listening to a lot more from the New Folk, Alternative, and Indie music since i played the game. I still listen to the other genres but the older i get the more Genres I end up enjoying

I saved Kate. My first play through I failed, though I think I was incredibly close to saving her. I used the proverb instead of the passage from Matthew. I cried when I failed to save her that first time. I saw it coming from a mile away, but I still failed. This time, I made sure I didn't miss any clues, didn't miss anything that could help Kate. I saved Kate! 

/////////////////////
I have Chloe's skull shirt from episode four, aswell as her necklace. I wanted to get Max's Jane Doe shirt but the color wasn't exact (It was like an off pink) so that's when I settled for the Chloe shirt. What do you guys have?
/////////////////////
I guess I'm just curious. I finished the game in January, and of course I have some nostalgia for it. I do plan on doing it all again making all different choices, and trying to get more pictures/interact with things I may have missed. Maybe I'll do it a week from now, maybe a year from now, I can't decide. So how many of you went back for round 2? Did your perspective of the game change after it?
/////////////////////
I feel like Ellen Page would make a good Max if she got the hairstyle. She's got that kinda shyness but determination, I don't know. Maybe Michael Cera as Warren? I can't really think of who would be a good fit for Chloe. Perhaps Jennifer Lawrence for Victoria, I feel like she could pull off the exterior meanness but inner doubt.
/////////////////////
Seriously this game is like crack, and I need my fix. So in love, never been so happy to be heartbroken. I can't get enough!
/////////////////////
I noticed Chloe's bullet necklace and it reminded me of a belief US marines hold - the Hogs tooth.

Upon graduation marines are given a bullet to wear as a necklace and according to this belief there is a bullet out there for everyone and by wearing the bullet around their neck it will never be fired thus making them invincible.

In the story Chloe is shot not once but three times - by nathan, by herself accidentally in the junkyard, and by jefferson but due to Max's actions these bullets may never be fired thus making Chloe invincible.
/////////////////////
Someone with more disposable income should buy it and just put a picture of Chloe on it

Hi everyone.

I can't really believe that I haven't made a post on here updating on the whole podcast situation, even though this is the place where I initially set it up, so sorry about that, but I thought I'd give it a go.

After almost 8 months of production, we have had so much happen to our show that we never thought possible. We got people behind the game talking to us about their experiences with the production of LiS, and what a great community it has formed. It's just crazy to think that because of you guys, we wouldn't have gotten this far.

I just want to thank everyone for tuning in every week to us talking about a game which broke us on so many levels. Our goal is to keep the spirit of the game alive for as long as we can, and we are honored that you listen to us every week! We are undergoing a big update regarding something special, so once we have it confirmed, we are going to post it here ASAP!

We also are accepting ideas for future episodes, so comment what you want to see us talk about, and we will put it on our list!

This show has been a crazy journey, and it wouldn't have been possible without you all. I may sound like a broken record, but it's true!

With endless thanks,

I went into this game knowing nothing about it ( the time rewind took me by surprise) and I gotta say that took some emotional toll on me. brilliant game. Best i've played in years. 
/////////////////////
Hello, first of all I just wanted to say how wonderful of a community this is. I remember playing this game for the first time and just being overtaken by emotions and the fact so many people have come together to talk and create such beautiful things from this game, is amazing. Obviously the one thing that I adored from this game was max and Chloe and their friendship. I loved how I could relate with my own best friend. 

I have not been able to touch the game, let alone go on this sub since my own best friend has died though. The one thing that stuck with me from this game was the doe, especially after my own friend died. I don't know if it was coincidence or fate but after my best friends funeral and i went outside to leave, i saw one single doe looking at me in the yard next to the church. It was such a sural and beautiful moment that i will never forget. 

I probably won't be able to touch this game for awhile and I'm signing off this community but I just wanted to share to say how much this game has also effected me in ways I can't explain. Remember to always hug the ones you love. Cheers 
/////////////////////
While reading fan-fic and listening to Spanish Sahara, I just came up with the idea of a quick-fire quiz thread! I'm thinking that we can all leave any LIS quiz questions, be them easy or hard. I've marked this post as spoilery for the whole series, so feel free to leave whatever quiz questions you want!

To attempt to answer a question, just quote the post with the question in it. I'll start with a couple of questions down in the comments!
/////////////////////
Here's my third Life is Strange inspired song: Fragile Reality. It's meant to be from Chloe's point of view, written about Rachel and Max. There aren't really any spoilers. I thought about her writing it near the end of episode 3.

And like I said in the title, I decorated my living room to look like Chloe's bedroom, which was a lot of fun. We're even hesitant to take down the set, even though it would be nice to have some of our closet doors back. :)

Anyway I hope you all like it!

Hey guys,

Just a quick heads up to tell you that Edge #293 (June 2016) features a cool Behind the scene about DONTNOD done by Ben Griffin.

It is a two pages paper (plus few artworks) with Oskar Guilbert, Stéphane Beauverger &amp; Grégory Szucs and mostly about the life at DONTNOD from its beginning (Adrift / RM) to their vision of the future of the studio. 

It is full of nice anecdotes as the studio making internal game jams, their way of working on small project groups or a drunk CEO swimming in the English Channel. Nice addition to the last [Polygon’s paper](http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/25/11473076/vampyr-dontnod-life-is-strange).

"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"


Anytime I feel a little down that LiS is over I just think of this Dr Seuss quote. I sometimes get one of the songs in my head and think about all the sadness and good times I had because of this game, and I get down. But I think of this quote and instead of feeling bad it's over, I remember it as a great experience and that sadness turns into nostalgia. I'm happy with my choices and story so the only thing I could be sad about is not experiencing those chill little moments with Chloe and Max. 


How do you deal with any sadness that it's over?
/////////////////////
I haven't kept up with the community for a couple months, so I'm not really sure whats out there. Especially nice would be some post bay-ending ones, just because I haven't really come across any good ones.
/////////////////////
I just had this thought regarding the ending.

In the bay ending, Max is willing to let a town be destroyed, along with countless residents killed, in order to save Chloe. 

I wanted to compare this to the numerous video game and movie stories featuring villains with the same motivations. I won't list any, but I'm sure many of you have encountered them. 

Picture this, big bad is willing to let the world burn, to destroy innocent lives, to protect or save the one/ones they love. We see him in a bad light, because he is directly opposing the protagonist and his goals, but in the end, he is only striving to help the ones he loves. Often enough, he doesn't even want to destroy society, but sees no alternative and will do what he must to preserve what he cares about. Sounds familiar enough, right? Well we might feel sympathy for or pity him, he is ultimately still the villain, and we have to stop him.

What Max is willing to do in sacrificing Arcadia Bay is kind of similar, wouldn't you say? Does that paint her in a villainous light when we think of it that way? Is it her conscience and guilt at what she caused in the bae ending what separates her from being that villain figure? Is it her lack of sadism, her lack of willingness to *directly* harm people as well? Or is she really just a villain, and we have to accept it? Where do we draw the line?

She may be innocent when playing with the consequences of her actions, but make no mistake, there would be nothing innocent about willingly letting an entire town full of inhabitants die when you can do something to save them. I will absolutely say that Max is being selfish when choosing the bae ending although I sympathize, but crossing the line into villainy? I'm just not sure.

I just love how this game blurs the lines between right and wrong, good and bad. I would love to hear some discussion about just how much of a villain or "good" person Max is.

EDIT: So from what I've been reading in the comments, it's being said that whether Max can be considered a villain or not depends on perspective. I absolutely agree. Max is not a villain to Chloe, but a heroine. If you use the same logic to apply to actual antagonists that are willing to sacrifice "the world" to protect their loved one, the protected person would equally be justified in saying that the antagonist is a hero.

But I think what people sometimes forget to consider is: Is that really what my loved one would want? To destroy society for their sake? Surely it is logical to think that one would be willing to sacrifice himself to save that many people?

Is there a way to change the game settings through .ini files? Game seems to work fine in my new laptop, it starts up and I messed around the title screen. But since I've already lost a laptop due to overheating and stuff I didn't start the game yet, and decided to lower the graphics, since when I enter on options everything is set to high by default. Managed to lower some stuff through the settings screen, but when I choose to disable anti-aliasing (MSAA) and click on "apply" the game freezes. Thanks in advance.

/////////////////////
This thought just came to me while thinking about the game today. What it the whole story really didn't have to do with Chloe or Jefferson's serial kidnappings, but only the Prescott family's past destruction of the Native American culture and land. **Just bare with me, this is a little long winded. Skip to the last paragraph if Max's powers and the storm interest you more than the specifics of connections**

Near the beginning of the game Ms. Grant tells Max that the Native Americans and the settlers lived in harmony when Blackwell was built (in 1910). For me, and many other players we just laughed at the line because it sounded ridiculous. Anyone who has studied early American history will tell you settlers, in almost every case, drove the natives out by force. "...[A]t that time [the 1840’s] the Pacific was never known to get too rough, but, since the coming of the white man, the ocean appears to be rough most of the time.” - The Quileute Chieftain newspaper (1910). The Quileute Tribe would have been on the Washington/Oregon coast at the time, so they are the most likely candidate for Arcadia Bay inhabitants. This particular quote came from a tribe member further north than Arcadia Bay would be. Then I thought, what if Ms. Grant wasn't lying or misinformed about the harmony between the settlers and the natives in Arcadia. It is not unheard of that settlers, in a handful of cases, did live with the natives quiet comfortably and peacefully (Arcadia does mean utopia after all). If that is the case why are none of the people we meet in Arcadia appear to be of Native American ancestry? What happened that there would suddenly be a divide between the two groups?

Judging by the barn, the Prescott's were only farmers back during the "peace" that Ms. Grant talks about (around 1903). They didn't have any involvement the initial building of Blackwell. What I believe happened is that Blackwell was built and to respect the land Tobanga was given to the natives as a peace offering, because Ms. Grant said it was brought by the settlers. Later, the Prescott's started building storm shelters and desecrating land of indigenous people with no respect and thus straining the relationship. This eventually lead to the natives being driven out when the Prescott's gained money and power. This may be mentioned in the line that Sean writes about purging Arcadia (Driving out the rest of the culture?). The Prescott's also built the Prescott dorms in 1998 right across form the Tobanga, who has said to overlook the school and now seems to be blocked by the new building. Prescott's have the Pan-Estates that is being built, this might have been the last straw.

Pan-Estates has to be stopped from being built no matter what. This means that Sean Prescott will either have to be dead or in a position that will ensure he will not go through with the plans. The real tell that this is the reason is when Chloe is dead during episode 5, the storm is not stopping. She is not the key to the storm and never was, but just a catalyst to the string of events. It also shows that Jefferson and Nathan where pawns to get to the king. This is shown when Max "fixes" the alternate timeline by telling David. Yes Nathan would have been caught, but the murders couldn't be directly tied to him. All Sean Prescott would have to do is get a lawyer that knows what he is doing and Nathan is off the hook and Sean doesn't have to stop with the build.  According to the newspaper in the alternate time line the Prescotts were put under investigation. With literal blood on Nathan's hands, the investigation would have been tougher and more leaning toward the Prescotts' involvement, not Jefferson's. 

This Native American connection could also account for Max's powers. The Tobanga has a Thunderbird at the top (usually means storm), a dog below that (protector), a bear (misunderstood) and at the bottom a human. This to me seems to tell the story of protector guarding the misunderstood (I'm thinking Chloe) and humanity (Arcadia) from the coming storm. The Quileute tribe believed in a hero named Q’wati who "traveled the world teaching people how they should act and giving instructions for their futures" and "[protect people] by changing the environment and getting rid of monsters.". Q'wati may have given Max "instructions for [her] future" through the means of time travel and he might have been behind changing the environment due to a monster, Sean Prescott. The protector has to decide if they will choose humanity or the misunderstood to have a future and the other will have their environment changed. One ending the Native American land is protected and one the land is able to heal and regrow (the deer in Arcadia Bay and the end of "Bae" ending).

**TL;DR: The story is really about the past, and ongoing, desecration of Native American culture in the United States**

**Random finding** : there is a fable about the Quileute tribe not being able to catch fish and the Thunderbird bringing whales to shore for them. The fisherman Max talks to in episode 2 says the fishing business is suffering. The whales wash up in episode 3.

Possible LiS Spoilers ahead!
My dad recorded an episode of the canadian police series 'rookie blue' where to my surprise a victim of a shooting incident versus a police officer was called Chloe Price. Apparently this is a recurring character! http://rookieblue.wikia.com/wiki/Chloe_Price . So this makes me wonder; is this a reference between one and the other, or mere coincidence?

Heya.  
A while back I started a playlist for some of the soundtrack of the game, and eventually added music that felt fitting.

/////////////////////
I've been lurking here for a long time now and the subreddit helped me so much so I finally decided that I want to share the odd and unlikely story of how I got here:


My story begins at the end of October 2015 on Twitch (one of the days which I now know to be directly after the release of EP5). At the time I did not care much about most games, I just watched Magic the Gathering a lot, but every now and then I'd check the Twitch directory what the top games were, just in case there was something interesting going on. I caught AGDQ and Evo this way for example. On that specific date however, there was a certain little game called Life is Strange - which I had never heard of before - with around 10k Viewers hovering just below the top spots. Now in 9 out of 10 alternate universes I wouldn't have cared, turned off the computer and never had the experience that I had in the last six months (*OMG it's ACTUALLY over six months already*). This universe however was generous to me and I decided that I would check the game and see what it was all about.


I decided to start watching the top stream and was greeted by blinding light, a certain brown-haired girl taped to a chair and some hipster-looking guy walking towards her with a syringe. I let it all trickle in and the next thing that happened was David coming in (*wait WHAT? Time travel? Seriously?*) and the following scene. - (*Yes Sir*). I was hooked.

Obviously I realized that I was right in the middle of a storybased game, yet I was already so intrigued I couldn't stop watching. I watched David shoot Jefferson without knowing who Chloe even was but still couldn't help feeling with Max and David. The next memorable Scene was Nathan's phone call and the feels got worse. (*This was the supposed bad guy, right? Well damn, looks like they were wrong about him*). Also this was the first time I got to listen in on the AMAZING soundtrack of the game. I watched through Max saving a few People among them a fisherman that she had to kill in order to save him and travel back through a photo (*wtf is going on with the time travel? This is crazy*) right into meeting some blue-haired girl who really seemed kind of a bitch at first, but then changed for the better, when she heard what had happened to Max.


Fast forward through the nightmare (*weird, but let's see what happens*) until the bathroom scene with Chloe's birthday as the code. I am still amazed by how they hid it in plain sight. Through the Diner and alternate Max we reach the hall of memories (*oh looks like they kissed before; they're so cute together*) (*at first sight their interactions feel like very best friends to me, but either way props to the developers for creating those two strong female leads.*). Then came the scene over Rachel's grave and I couldn't help but shed a tear over Ashley's (and Hannah's) gutwrenching performance.


Little did I know what was still to come.


So we have the cliff-scence and Chloe suggests sacrificing herself (*So Max saved her life multiple times? Butterfly effect? Fuck!*) and the choice pops up. (*FUCK*) . The streamer chose to sacrifice Chloe and what followed was me crying to Spanish Sahara.


Now remember: All of this happened without me knowing anything of episodes 1-4. I just couldn't stop watching. I was blown away and I craved more.


So over the next few days I watched more and more streamers playing the game (I couldn't find anyone streaming from the beginning, probably because everybody was done with Episode 4 and naturally wanted to see the end). So I caught snippets of the earlier episodes here and there and the game managed to surprise me again and again, in particular the episode-endings of episodes 2,3 and 4 and a certain scene in the beginning of Episode 4. These scenes came as hammerblows, but I also realized that Life is Strange was far from a game about despair: its setting was warm and alive and somehow genuinely happy despite all the problems in Arcadia Bay.


Post-LiS-Depression kicked in. An odd feeling of sadness and happiness at the same time... knowing that it was over and I would never experience it for the first time again... remembering all the tragedy... but also knowing I was part of something great, something extraordinary.


I didn't really know how to cope with the feels, because no kind of fiction has ever done this to me (and I read A LOT), but looking back three things helped me get through it:


1) At some point I found this subreddit and lurked along. Seeing how others felt the same was a great experience and has finally made me share my story. I feel certain, People here will understand me and all the - how to best say it? - positiveness here in the subreddit makes me glad to be a part of it.


2) In January I finally got the limited edition and played through the game for the first time, which - for me - was a rather odd experience kind of like rewatching a favourite movie except that in my case it was somehow an experience of conclusion, because everything I knew came from other people's streams (I know the questions will come, so here's the answer: BAE)


3) The company of awesome People, partially in real life, partially online. I want to mention one person especially and that is Pumpkinberry, a twitch-streamer who mostly streams story-driven games. I realized only recently, how much being on her stream had actually helped me. I actually found her when she streamed Life is Strange at first and somehow just decided to come back there again and again. To understand why she helped me so much, just let me say that she is to twitch what this subreddit is to reddit: She is entertaining, and a good person (someone you'd want to be friends with) and it's possible to have actually interesting discussions in her chat, because that chat happens to be possibly the least toxic place on twitch (again compare this subreddit to the average subreddit to get my meaning). So if you want to hang out at such a place, come find her, she streams Monday to Friday 2pm-6pm (EST)/ 8 pm-midnight (CET=GMT+1). I'm still there more often then not and consider a few of the People there almost friends by now:

https://www.twitch.tv/pumpkinberry/profile


Sorry if this looks like advertising, but I sincerely mean it and want to give others in the same situation the same chance.


Looking back, I feel like the entire experience has made me grow up a lot. I have a much more positive outlook on live and on other people now.


To conclude, let me just say again, that it's great to be here with all of you. It's good company.

For those who don't know (although everyone here probably does know) Remember Me is Dontnod's other game. I'm playing it for the first time and when I saw the character Olga I immediately thought of Victoria.
/////////////////////
So it's a weird thing really but recent events in my life (such as a recent cancer diagnosis for my dad, funeral for a friend, etc.) along with playing Life is Strange has pushed me into a minor existential crisis.

I suddenly seem EXTRA aware and curious about each person I see - their lives, their struggles, their stories.  

I started crying in Kroger when Arlo Guthrie came on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvMS_ykiLiQ

I'm a 32 year old male.  I'm not used to all these FEELS.  Ugh.

Just thought I'd share my mushy story.  (I hope my friends don't reddit stalk me)

So anyway, take care everyone.
/////////////////////
So is this the first time David hit Chloe or has he done this before?

In my first playthrough, I didn’t hide and I took the blame for the joint. Chloe seemed like a selfish jerk for blaming Max and David seemed like and overbearing asshole but I was okay with that so I didn’t bother rewinding. It just looked like a rebellious teenager and an authoritarian butting heads. Now I’m playing it again and any choice that blames Chloe ends with her getting backhanded. 

This obviously isn’t their first argument and a line like “don’t touch me again asshole, that’s the last time” makes David look really fucking bad here. David saying “you asked for that” makes him look even worse. 

And if this isn’t the first time, does Joyce know? And if she does then what does that say about her?

I don’t know, maybe I’m just reading too far into things.  It’s just that I grew up with a dad whose discipline regularly went way too far so this scene really stirred some shit up.


EDIT: Okay, I just finished Episode 5 again and I think this is probably the first time David hit her. The way Joyce talks about it in Episode 2 and when David apologizes to Max for it in Episode 5 makes it sound like the only time. I guess some of the dialogue just made it seem ambiguous to me. 

Looks like I shouldn't have made this kind of post in the middle of a playthrough. :)
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
I'm sure you see many posts like this, where someone has just finished the game, but I've got say this game far exceeded my expectations.

Now I actually played Remember Me not long after its release and whilst the gameplay was a poor Batman Arkham clone, I was won over by the Art style, story, Nilin, Neo-Paris and the memory remixes. It was severely overlooked by critics as average and yet I could tell there was a truly great game hidden away in there. So at that point Dontnod had my attention.

It seems the most underused but unique part of Remember me was the memory remixes, which I very glad they managed to reuse in LiS.

However I was not prepared at all the emotional rollercoster that was to play out. At the end of each episode my feelings could be summed up as:

* Episode 1 - Well this is cool
* Episode 2 - Phew that was intense
* Episode 3 - WTF? No.
* Episode 4 - NOOOOOOOO
* Episode 5 - Rekt.

I've seen some drama in Steam Discussion (not exactly the least toxic place ever) about people hating the endings, as a veteran of the Mass Effect 3 endings way back in March 2012 pre the extended cut I really don't understand why this would the case.

Both endings are logical but neither is 100% happy, as of the extended cut ME3 my feelings where the same, you can't always have a happy ending.

In the end I chose to sacrifice Chloe and cried like a baby at the end. That decision took what seemed like 10 minutes. Not doing so seemed to play into the selfish brat like max from the alternative reality in the beginning of episode 4 (look at your SMS messages to see what I mean if you haven't).

I hope they don't do a sequel and ruin it, I don't see how a sequel would even work with a new set of characters  and still capture the greatness in Season 1. It was as close to a perfect experience I've had with a game for a very long time. Dontnod delivered on the potential I saw back in Remember Me.

Also dat soundtrack!

I've rambled on and I'm sure you've all heard this before, glad I finally played it and no idea why I hadn't earlier it just got pushed down the Steam backlog.

TLDR: LiS was basically perfect should have been GoTY and up till this week I thought the Witcher 3 was GoTY, no more.

*****

EDIT: To clarify why I thought saving Chloe was selfish from my comments below

It's certainly not black and white either way. 

My main reason for coming to the decision was based on The brat max became in Ep. 4 and the discussion with herself in the nightmare. 

Sacrificing the town and potentially killing off characters like Kate, Warren, Joyce, David etc would actually mean a lot of what Max did with her powers was pointless and therefore nullified her argument she used her powers for good. 

By saving Chloe she threw all that away, choosing to save Chloe for herself. 

That's why I deemed it seemed selfish and hypocritical, something Max herself argued she wasn't in relation to her powers.

By not caring about the consequences (letting the bay get smashed up) and going "Oh well" is a fairly selfish act when you have the power to make that not happen.

Of course losing Chloe was what turned Max into a brat in Episode 4 so the alternative is also the same counter argument to my decision, in that losing Chloe will drive Max off the rails in the same way losing William did for Chloe. It's a massive headfucker and there is no truly right answer.

It what's so great about LiS, people who have criticised the endings seem to say it was poor writing. 

In my view it's actually great writing that so many different viewpoints can fit into a 50/50 choice. It suits the whole overarching narrative of the story with regards the butterfly effect, a simple choice can lead to many different outcomes with vastly varied magnitudes.

However anyone who thinks there is only 1 true ending I think has missed the whole point on the entire story.

That was my thought process at 1:30 am last night anyway.

Great characters, great environment, great soundtrack and one of the greatest games ever made :). This game has that human touch which most games miss out on. This is the first time in my life that I have had to think really hard before making choices in-game. The way the game captured various moments and the music accompanying various sequences in the game was simply magnificent. The dreamlike sequences before the credits rolled in at the end of each episode left me in awe. I finished all five episodes within 3 days. Hats off to the developers. They have created something so unique and beautiful. I really do hope that they come up with season 2 which hopefully comes with the same magical experience as season 1. How did you guys feel after finishing the game?

EDIT: Mom passed away. The sadness and emptiness is overwhelming. :(

I came across [this 30 minute short](https://vimeo.com/123383629) when looking up LiS stuff. It's about the coastal town of Arcadia Bay, Oregon and things are not what they seem. The filmmakers apparently had no idea about the game and had developed it in 2014. The short has some interesting small details: it features Polaroid pictures and the main character keeps a journal. 


Overall, I'm not a fan of the short. It makes little sense but I thought the synchronicity of two unrelated projects featuring strangeness in an Arcadia Bay, OR was too interesting not to share.
/////////////////////
So, the commonly accepted canon is that Brooke is very into Warren and, as a result, jealous of Max. Brooke will try to make Max jealous by saying she constantly talks with Warren about science or about how they're going to the drive-in together (if you refuse to go with Warren).

This seems pretty straight-forward, right? Brooke is into Warren but Warren likes Max so Brooke hates Max.

Except, she doesn't.

Brooke actually praises Max on several occasions going as far as to call her "the bravest person she's ever known", talks to her on a regular basis and even invites her on a "drone date".

When she uses Warren to make Max jealous it's not out of spite. It's because she actually wants Max to get jealous and pursue *her* instead.

This would also explain why she often seems so condescending at times. She's not stack up. Just socially inept. Many people like that are known to mock people they like, perceiving it as "playful teasing" instead.

Of course, this is just a theory. What do you guys think? Could it hold any ground or am I just grasping at straws here?
/////////////////////
I'm testing out some of my skills as a Games Designer, and I'm beginning to deconstruct Life is Strange, to understand the decisions they made. It's fun but I feel like I can miss things out.

From a video game perspective not a story, I think that the choice of making this into a video game rather than a movie or a book is an important choice. I believe this is a step forward in games design, Life is Strange is a spearhead of a new genre that isn't considered a game. Many times I've heard people ask 'What is this game?' when watching playthrough's of popular YouTubers.

I finished all 5 episodes within 2 days and that's while I'm learning for my finals... It really had me hooked. Lovable characters, an amazing story arc (heck, I even liked the ending), great ambience, both through music (really love the soundtrack, actually one of the main reasons I decided to get LiS instead of Gone Home) and graphics. This game was so touching, so charming, so beautiful, so... I don't know really. Probably my favourite game ever now.

Big shout out to Dontnod for creating something this great!

Never before have I seen a community that relates and helps each other out. If there are disagreements here (generally) they are understanding and not insulting.

I was just wondering how do you imagine Chloe's life after the ending in which you sacrifice Arcadia Bay. Do you think she'll live happily after? Or do you think that it was her destiny to die and the universe will try it's best to kill her? Will she still be dying daily like during the game? Basically, do you think that she has a chance to live long and happy life?
/////////////////////
Okay, this is a long post. I'm going to end up talking about a few conclusions I made about the game over time... ones that some people may not agree with. But, if you would, keep reading! Because I may not agree with them anymore either. I'm pretty sure I went through literal stages of grief with this game, as crazy as that sounds, and now I'm just trying to get my own thoughts in order by writing them down. Then if anybody else finds this post worthwhile, well, great.

I preordered Life Is Strange and originally played the episodes as they were released. Like many fans, the game's endings left me with a feeling of disappointment and even anger. I picked one ending, reloaded and picked the other, and I just didn't like either of them. I had the litany of complaints we've all heard many times by now: All my choices were nullified. It was so predictable. Why just the two endings? Why don't we find out what happened to anyone else? One of the endings was so much shorter with so much less closure, clearly they had a "canon" ending in mind. Max could've saved everyone if she'd just done THIS or THIS. Is this explained by Square Enix cutting their budget? And so on. Now, I still think most of those criticisms have some validity, but I also think now that they're missing the point a bit. But again, I'm not here to complain or rehash any old debates. Please read on.

Right after playing it, it was hard for me to even think about the game. I'd finished episodes 1-4 each with weeks to wait before the next one, all the time in the world for speculation, theorizing, and predictions. I loved episodes 1-4. Episode 5, I thought, just didn't live up to the rest. It wasn't the ending I'd imagined. And that's where I left it for a while. It was five months before I really thought about the game again. The directors' commentary had come out, and after putting it off for a while, I decided I should just go ahead, take an hour of my life, and give it a listen, not expecting any of it to change my mind.

At the end of the commentary, the thing that struck me the most was one offhand comment about Max's first rewind -- as I'm sure everybody here remembers, instead of just rewinding the usual few seconds, she snaps back to Jefferson's lecture minutes before. "Yes, it was inconsistent with the way her powers work in the rest of the game," they said, more or less, "but consistency there wasn't the priority."

With that one thought, it started to fall into place for me. This was not a literal time travel tale. The rewind was just a device. Yes, in a realistic take on time travel, maybe the storm wouldn't make sense, maybe there would be a logical way to really fix everything... but this was not that kind of story. In a way, the story almost makes more sense as something happening within Max's head. Upon finding that her best friend just died on a bathroom floor before Max ever reconnected with her, Max imagines what could have been if she had the power to change that one moment -- what would it be like to get to know an older Chloe? What has she been through? What is her adult self like? What problems does she have now? How could Max have helped her?

Now, I don't think that's the directors' actual intended interpretation. All I'm trying to say is that the device -- whether that's magical time travel powers or "it was all just a dream" -- is unimportant. It's almost irrelevant. The core of the story is Max and Chloe.

And THEN I thought I had it. This story is about loss, lost friends and lost opportunities. A confident Max would have approached Chloe shortly after arriving at Blackwell, if they ever lost contact to begin with. They would have had these experiences of getting to know one another again. But that confident Max didn't exist, and so something had to substitute for confidence. And in this story, that's time travel powers. Through magical powers, we learn what a more confident, less backwards-focused Max could have experienced. We experience a full exploration of her relationship with Chloe. But (and this is the key part) it's an experience she never had. An opportunity that was irrevocably lost. Chloe is dead. That whole week, Chloe is dead. There is nothing Max can do to change it. The story is an exploration of a deep loss and at the end of it, we either accept Chloe's death or we deny it -- deny reality, represented by the destruction of the entire town.

I thought this was a rather nihilistic approach to the story, but it was a valid message. Sometimes we do just have to accept things that we cannot change, and that lesson is one that both Max and Chloe have not learned till the end. I decided that, almost half a year later, I would give the game an entire second playthrough. I would keep this idea in mind -- that the story was really about grief and acceptance -- and I would enjoy Max's time with Chloe... and then accept that she was gone.

My first playthrough, I saved Chloe, but that was just perpetuating denial. To learn the game's real lesson, I would have to let her go, and save Arcadia Bay instead. That would be my final choice.

I found myself rushing through much of episodes 1 and 2 in a way that I didn't the first time. I was eager to get to the meat of the story -- the times with Chloe, mostly, but also key moments like Kate on the rooftop. In episode 3, I slowed down. I think episode 3 is brilliantly paced. It's long enough but it flies by and makes me wish for more. More time in the pool, or chilling in Chloe's room the morning after. I'd almost forgotten how great those moments were, and I could remember experiencing them for the first time.

In episode 4, as with my first playthrough, I allowed Alt Chloe to convince Max to let her die. It wasn't any less emotional for me this time than the first time. But with the benefit of knowing what came after, I found myself struck by the parallels between this request and the one at the end of episode 5. I found myself thinking, "I'll let you go this time, Chloe, but I'm not sure I can the next time you ask." I was starting to realize that my plan for this playthrough was going wrong.

I was playing an episode a day, and at the same time, I was exploring interviews done by the developers in the time that I hadn't been thinking about the game. Certain remarks stood out to me: No, there was no budget cut that explained episode 5. They'd ended the game exactly the way they'd had in mind all along. They wanted the two endings to have equal validity. Neither was canon, or both were. The difference in length was explained by the songs they chose for each, nothing more -- while accepting the criticism that maybe they could've tried harder to make them equal lengths. The lack of closure when saving Chloe is intentional -- you make your choice to give up the town, so you live with not knowing who lives and who dies, and the player imagines what they want to happen next. It was just part of the lesson of not looking back.

I believe them. While there are still things to criticize, I believe now that they meant for each ending to teach a similar lesson in a different way. The endings were NOT all about acceptance vs. denial, that was just one half of it. There was another lesson in saving Chloe... that sometimes you'll make mistakes you can't undo, but then you just look forward, and find comfort where you can. With a loved one, perhaps. They are both canon endings.

So I went into episode 5. Now, I do think episode 5 has problems. Jefferson's endless monologues are not a high point for me, and the episode has pacing problems starting at the Two Whales scene (Max's "Long story short, Jefferson is scary and dangerous" followed by Warren's instant acceptance then wizardly explanation of the entire story is the most ridiculous moment in the game) and continuing through the nightmare. The developers say happily that they had a lot of ideas about the nightmare sequence. Yes, great, but they shouldn't have used all of them. I get that they were going for Lynchesque surrealism, but it just goes on too long, breaks the fourth wall unnecessarily, and is weirdly hostile to the player in places. But a benefit of a second playthrough is lacking that mix of dread and impatience I felt the first time as I approached the inevitable ending. I knew what was coming and how long it would take, and that made it easier to get through. On the positive side, that scene with Max and Other Max, where you're relentlessly called out on the darker implications of your actions, is great. I got goosebumps when Chloe stormed in to put a stop to it. I wish that one scene had more to it.

I took my time walking through the Chloe Price Memorial Museum and then found myself at the lighthouse faced with that final choice again. Again, my original plan was to choose to sacrifice Chloe, to accept her death, and not look back. But wasn't there already a story about accepting the loss of a loved one, not being able to change the past? That's the story of William, of Chloe and Joyce's different reactions to his death, and Max's attempt to change it. And wasn't there already a story about the struggle to find meaning in a senseless death? That's the story of Rachel, of Chloe's desperation to find some other explanation, some story she could hold in her head of Rachel still being alive. Did my story, the story I was stitching together out of my experiences and choices with this game, need another senseless death?

"I don't blame you for wanting me out of your life after all my drama," Chloe says, then later, "I don't deserve it. I'm so selfish. There's so many more people in Arcadia Bay who should live, way more than me." Okay Chloe, easy there, I get it. You just found out that the first real love of your life was murdered. That's horrible, but it also means she didn't abandon you. And Max has stuck with you through everything this week. You know your mom cares, and you've discovered that even your stepfather cares, even if he's awful at showing it. You're just now realizing all this, and thinking back to how you've acted over the past five years, and you're feeling worthless. Undeserving of all this love. You feel you've been unworthy of it.

But Max promised to always have your back, and she meant it. You are worthy of that much love, and there's only one thing Max can do right now to prove it. It's the best opportunity anyone in history has ever had to prove how much someone else means to them. Or as someone with far more talent than me expressed it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvZxmgLfNA

I sacrificed Arcadia Bay and, this time, I didn't even look at the other ending. Fuck accepting your fate. I just couldn't do it. Max and Chloe are there at that moment in history for a reason, and it's to make the only choice Max can make. Time to look ahead.

If you've read all this, thank you! Only other thing I'll say is I don't blame anybody for sacrificing Chloe, so please don't read it like that. It's a tough choice and both sides of the story have a valuable moral. We each experienced the story that made sense for us. And I love this game again.
/////////////////////
I have a question about AutoMax's concept. I didn't think about it until now. When Max returns to the time to William second time (After accepting/refusing Chloe's Request), she rips the picture.
What if she didn't rip the picture? Would it cause some sort of loop? Like William will die and AutoMax would basically repeat the action again of photo hopping after Chloe's meltdown with Rachel, and the end result is back in the alternate timeline?

is that I want to love someone so much that I am willing to let a town be destroyed for them.

Hi all. First time poster in this sub. I completed this game in one sitting last night, to be honest a friend lent me the game and I was quite reserved over it as I've heard numerous things about it. But once I started to play i found it to be a true master piece, I couldn't put it down. The over all story was amazing. The conquenses to your actions were amazing. I felt really connected to the characters and story. This is my first game I've obtained the platinum trophy on. This is my first time playing this sort of game, I'm so glad that I gave it a chance to amaze me.
/////////////////////
I love that high you enter after you finish something and get to explore all the fan content and discussion without fear of spoilers. I love being able to love something because I’m always afraid my ability to love will go away and it’s a relief when I get truly excited about a new thing again. Life is Strange feels particularly special because I suppose I'm past the coming-of-age age now, but the story instilled in me some kind of feeling about life that I've been missing (or cynical about) for a long time.


I like how I only just LIKED Life is Strange at first. I wasn’t immediately enthralled by the game or Chloe, but now you'd have to pry Chloe from my/Max's cold dead hands before I would ever make a decision to leave Chloe behind. I actually grew to care about all the characters and became invested in the story slowly, which speaks to the storytelling.


Like many here, I found the Bae over Bay ending lacking compared to the alt ending, but it also felt incredibly right for the message the creators wanted to convey for growing up. We don't always get closure. (That's okay, I made my own headcanon in which all the characters I cared about survived :( )


Some of the choices we had to make were heart-wrenching, but the *worst* one for me wasn't even #BaeOverBay (That was personally an obvious decision from the very moment I saw Alt!Chloe at the end of EP3. I knew I had to protect her forever.) - it was the assisted suicide decision in EP4. For many of the difficult choices regarding the safety of characters like Kate, Frank, Alyssa, Victoria, etc, I cheated and googled to make sure I could save them as best I could, but there was really no right decision for this one. My friend even told me the outcome, that it doesn't really matter because you go back to the 'main' timeline anyways, but it still took me a couple of days to play again and make my choice. Ultimately, I did what Chloe wanted, which only further cemented my decision at the end of EP5 to be honest. I already killed her once, there was no way I was sacrificing her again.

The Jefferson twist! I had some idea of the Chloe pain that was awaiting me because of things I saw on my Tumblr dash last year though I didn't really pay attention. But I had no idea about JEFFERSON. [me](http://replygif.net/i/1314.gif) when his face appeared instead of Nathan's as I was expecting. I saw some comments that it was out of nowhere, but it fits perfectly imo and it was a very enjoyable unexpected twist for me. I was already theorizing that Nathan was not as evil as he seemed given how unstable he was, the abuse from his father, his genuine happy? surprise when he thought Max was Rachel at the diner, alt!Nathan's calmer behaviour, all those little things that pointed out that he could never be the mastermind of true evil. I just didn't pick up on the Jefferson signs.

I wish the game would've explored the Prescott's/spirit animals/Native American thing a lot more. There were so many hints about it that I felt certain there was going to be some summoning supernatural prophesy element to the tornado and Max's powers.

Anyways, I just finished my exams, so I have a lot time to explore all the fan-created content and theories, past discussions, and think about my own life thanks to this game. Cheers!

Pricefield forever.
/////////////////////
This game inspired me to finally do a couple of things I have been putting off for a while and also changed me a little.


First - I'm not a great artist, but I really appreciate the beauty all around me and have always wanted to capture that. So I finally bought a decent camera online and a beginner's photography book and am learning how to take decent pics. If I get good enough by the upcoming holidays, my wife has agreed to let me buy an introductory DSLR. I know, I know, not as cool as Max's analog, but the convenience for reviewing and deleting photos for a beginner is huge in my opinion.

Second - Along with photos for memories, I think I might start writing some of my thoughts and experiences down in a journal. I recently tried to remember what was going on in my life a few years ago... No idea. Kind of sad I have lost that.

Third - This game has such beautiful acoustic music, It compelled me to dust off my Acoustic guitar and start learning how to play the soundtrack, amongst other songs I like.

Finally - I find myself stopping and really living in the moment more. Just kind of meditating and taking everything in around me that's happening in the present. I feel a lot happier and peaceful when I do this.

How have you changed?
/////////////////////
When in the game did you think the voice-acting really stood out?

This is a weird one, but for some reason I really like the delivery of Max's "Use the damn chair!" in Episode 3.

/////////////////////
I'm creating a presentation that involves Life is Strange, particularly Kate Marsh. I was wondering if someone has a background or just picture in general of Max's journal page, COMPLETELY blank? No words or pictures on it! :)

You can better call it Feels Simulator 2015-16, or I Wanna wake up but i cant... tm...

I was in the middle of ep 3 or 4 (cant remember, doesnt matter) when i searched some tips on how to save frank, I stumbled across a picture of the Last Decision (yes, capitalized) and instantly clicked it away, i was spoiled...

I had to stop my gaming session a few minutes later, and the evening and next day i could think of nothing but what to choose, Chloe or the town?

I played further, and i absolutely didnt expect the nightmare. Me, being a philosophy nerd, instantly found out she was mentally tortured, her whole subconscious was having the same struggle i had, Chloe or the town?

I then came back to walk to the lighthouse, I then sat down and thought about the choice for more than a minute and finally said; "Fuck it, im doing both and see what's best"

I chose the town's sacrifice first, to silence my nightmares.

Then I chose Chloe's

First, i hoped for a better ending to be in the game, a secret one, something that could only be unlocked by something crazy, like rewinding in the middle of class, to say some crazy thing, or to straight warn everybody about the tornado and prove it with time powers, scientific experiments be damned.

Then i saw that butterfly on the casing of Chloe's grave, and instantly thought i knew i made the right choice, i read all about "butterfly effect", and this (in some sane and dreamy part of my mind) was for me a silent nod of the universe to me(/max) that I made the right choice.

And now I can silently hate and love this game in peace.

God, my brain is a mess now...

**UPDATE:** Since in Sweden it was late at night when I posted this, I went to bed really happy about my 10-15 replies. I couldn't believe my eyes when I woke up to more than 100! 

I've read through a lot of your responses, and you had so many interesting thoughts and opinions. Some of you posted questions for me (which I sadly can't answer since the form is anonymous), and some of you posted stuff that made me laugh, like "hella" and "shaka brah". I also received many wishes of luck - thank you! :) For people who posted feedback, that will be included in my essay as I'll discuss the study limitations as well. Thanks for providing feedback! I've never made a survey before, so it was valuable to me.  

**I'll close the survey now at 240 replies, which is absolutely amazing! Thanks again for taking the time to help me &lt;3**
/////////////////////
I know I'm late to the party, but I just finished the game last night, and I was a little disappointed with the ending options. My issue with the endings of the game is that both of them cause so many (or all) of your choices are reset overall. 
However, out of everything, the bayoverbae ending is the worst.
I know that it's the most complete ending and oh "you can't change destiny blablabla", but that's not only such a typical bs ending, but that kind of logic only works when the time traveller was selfish and created a time travel machine. In this game, the power was given to her, seemingly to make things better, but instead it was to slap her in the face and fuck with her head. I think it would have been more interesting had it been that nature gave her that power in order to right some wrongs in the world. Her power needs purpose, or it feels useless. There are still plenty of "tough" choices that could have been made - it didn't have to be an all or nothing deal. 
P.S: I chose to save Chloe, simply because going back to make her not discover her power felt so empty and pointless for the above reasons. I refused to accept that her powers were a mistake.

Disclaimer: I don't think there's anything wrong with people who chose the sacrifice Chloe ending. This is just coming from someone who strongly believes in the Bae ending. 


As a die hard supporter of the sacrifice Arcadia bay/save Chloe ending, I have kind of a problem with the sacrifice Chloe ending existing. Just from an emotional standpoint. I know in my canon Chloe and Max ride off and have happy adventures (they'll have some emotional hurt from the bay being destroyed, but they have each other for support. They'll be okay.) I'll never choose the sacrifice Chloe in my play throughs, and it's not my canon, but I can't help but feel sad that it exists. I've kind of gotten over it by thinking "well if that ending happens then she'll just travel back in time and change her decision". Again that's just my personal canon. 


I'll occasionally run into some post-sacrifice Chloe fan art and get sad. Then I'll look up some cute Pricefield epilogue art and use that as my eye bleach. I'll have to tell myself "it's okay, Chloe is alive and they're together in my canon". As you can see I'm very emotionally invested in this story and characters lol. 


Maybe I'm just crazy, but I sometimes have a problem thinking of the Bay ending being a possibility. It will never be canon to ME, but I know it does for others. Maybe I'm just crazy lol. 


Anybody else feel the same or know where I'm coming from? 
/////////////////////
Especially the Italien version, is it equally good? I worry since I'm recommending this game to some italian exchange students, and I don't know if putting it to Italien is as good as the english version. Before i get any further, does anyone know?
/////////////////////
No hate, but I've been seeing a lot of Grahamscott on my Tumblr dashboard since I started tracking the LIS tag, so I'm just curious why people ship Grahamscott?
/////////////////////
I can't believe this sub exists, but I'm so glad that it does. I never thought that a game could impact my life so heavily and I didn't even know how to deal with that. Honestly, I still don't but without this community it would be a lot more difficult as I find my way through my feelings and the hole that this game left. It's amazing to see how many people are dealing with the same things. I seriously thought I was just crazy. I even thought I was a little late to jump on the train, but to my surprise people are still here. I guess I just wanted to thank everyone for actively participating in our "recovery". 

Do any of you have anything that helps with the aftermath? I'm finding that fanfiction helps quite a bit. But I'm open for anything related to this world at this point. I'll admit I'm probably a little obsessed with it...but I just finished the game last week. From what I've read, apparently it takes months to get over this thing. If ever at all. 

I want to talk about this stuff. How it affects different people. If it's changed them as much as it has me. Everything. Obviously what better place to start than here, right? 

Edit: You guys are the best! You all have made the PLiSD much more tolerable and for that, I thank you.
/////////////////////
So yeah, it's been over four hours since I completed the game, and I'm still as mind-blown over the ending as I was just after completing it. I'm out of words, I really can't put a finger on what I'm feeling, I'm neither sad, happy or angry, but I'm definitely not indifferent, I just fell like my emotions are all over the place.  


The story, the music, the visuals, the characters, everything was perfect, and relatable. 


I've always been fascinated by the variety of the US, so as always, when I'm finishing a game situated in the US, I'm always wondering about the chances of it being real, by that I mean if a real-life Max, Chloe, Warren and whatnot is actually out there, not exact lookalikes, but more-so the personalities and relationships. Not only do I wonder about the characters being real, but also about the places that it's situated in, is there a "lookalike" Arcadia Bay, and what about the Blackwell Academy? Stuff like this leave me wondering for days, even months. If I ever find out, I'll have to make a trip there, which may be hard since I'm living in Denmark. 


Which leads me to my last point, I *always* have a hard time letting go, and with this game being so good, it's even harder. It's like, I don't want it to end, I want to continue as Max going about her normal routine. I do know that a season 2 may be on it's way, but I doubt that it will leave the same feeling as I have now. 


The point of this post? I really don't know, I just wanted to vent out what I'm feeling since it had such a huge impact on me.

If someone who feels the same wants to share their feelings, if so, comment or PM me, I really want to hear your story!

/////////////////////
IF there is a season 2 that follows a new cast of characters, I think they could easily work both endings in. 
You'd have to import your save or choose key choices at the start of the game from season 1. Then later on in season 2, maybe you'd have to go through this traveling photographers phone to get a contact or something. Maybe you break into the "photographers" hotel room. Either way there are voicemails for you to snoop through. If you chose to save Arcadia Bay you get Kate leaving her a voicemail to stop by Arcadia and have tea. But if you chose to save Chloe you hear Chloe leaving the "photographer" a cute message about getting more junk food or something. Obviously it would be Max's phone or apartment.
It may sound dumb, but it would be cool to incorporate both endings by importing the final choice without revolving a whole game around it.

Sorry if something like this has been said before: I'm just holding onto hope theirs a S2 with references.
/////////////////////
I finished the game with the option to sacrifice Chloe, and really glad I did, as the alternate ending which I ended up looking up at a later time, in which you sacrifice Arcadia Bay was really disappointing.

Sorry if this has been discussed already, as I am new to the thread and game, but I wish there would have been talks of going to Los angeles, because Chloe and Rachel never got to, or Portland, which is also discussed in the game.

As someone whose favorite character was Nathan, I was really sad about the lackness of him in the end :( Yeayea I know the main story was about Chloe and Max and their relationship but I just didn't feel it. Actually I didn't really like other characters except for Nathan, Dana, Kate, Frank and at times Max. So when we first go to  Nathan's room in ep 4 I was super excited to get to know more about him! He had so much potential but was then totally dropped in ep 5.

Like how did he know about the storm? What David did for Nathan (Sean's thank you in his garage)? What's Nathan and his father's relationship and the history with his family? How did he come to work with Jefferson and how much was he a part of it? What's his actual diagnose? And what about his relationship with Rachel? (And no I don't believe it was Nathan who killed her) And the list of questions go on...

But yeah, anyone else feel the same? I wish we could get like a DLC or something from Nathan's POV :(

In the game a hurricane is used to wipe out a city of people, and it was not until yesterday when I read up on the concentration kamp Auschwitz that I discovered that the gas they used to kill around 1,1 million people is named after a hurricane. This gas they used was branded Zyklon-B. Zyklon is german for cyclone, a tropical storm like the one that hit arcadia bay (though to be precise this would be called a hurricane instead of a cyclone only due to the location at which it occurs, but it's the same natural phenomena nonetheless).
I know this link seems far-fetched and probably by no way intended but I thought it was interesting to bring it up anyway :)
/////////////////////
So i've finished the game 5 days ago for the first time and i'm just recovering from the infamous "post game depression".

Now that my mind is juuuust a little clearer, i noticed that i'm not THAT sad about the ending, but much more about the fact that it is over.

Wether you choose the Bae or the Bay ending, wether you liked or not said endings, there is nothing left but a huge hole drifted in your heart left by the game. 

That's what really stroke me about LiS. Considering there's (almost) no challenge from the gameplay and no gameover, the only thing you can connect to is the characters. But now, it's over. Even if there's a season 2 (and i damn hope there will be), it will be without Chloe, Max or any other of the characters we learn to like or hate. Even at the end of episode 4 [EP4 SPOILERS](#s "when we discover that Jefferson is the killer"), there were still episode 5 following up. Now, there's no episode 6 except the one we create inside our own mind.

And i kinda hate that. I tried to fill that hole with fanfiction, fanart, soundtracks, theories and whatnot, but still, i can't help but feel somewhat sad that i won't be able to play a "fresh" start with this game. Or continue the adventure.

That's proably what's the worst and the best thing about LiS. Wether you liked it or not, the ending did not let you indifferent.

Anyway, just wanted to share some of my feeling with someone ( part of the therapy i guess ha, ha ha... ha....).

*Spoilers*


I just played Victoria's route and it was fun. She took me on Nathan's yacht, and I bought her a figurine. She bought me breakfast and a new outfit. I took a picture of her by the lighthouse. We won the contest. She invited me to her room and she kissed me. It was cute and I enjoyed it.

I was going to play Rachel's playthrough, but maybe another time.
/////////////////////
So I've beaten the game 3 times in the past month, and I absolutely love it. One thing that stood out was the soundtrack, which was probably one of the main reasons certain parts made me shed a couple tears (No spoilers but anyone who has played it, knows what I am talking about)

So the other day I was getting ready for work, I put my ear buds in and just put my music on shuffle. Got my stuff for a few minutes, stepped outside and right when I closed the door behind me, All of You by Syd Matters came on. I started walking down the sidewalk and just thought of the beginning of the game and it just fit perfectly. Was such an awesome moment haha

I also had Mountains by Message to Bears come on when I was waiting for the bus and it made me think of the corresponding scene in the game and I literally shed a tear just due to that. Ya, this game changed me quite a bit. 
/////////////////////
What about do you think about Nathan? And what about Caulscott?

Hello all, I want to share some thoughts I've been having about the whole tornado business and the game has been leaving some pretty hefty clues that the tornado was probably going to arrive no matter what in the end.

Now before you ask, yes, I did save Chloe in the end, and it wasn't just an emotional response, I also tried to look at things logically. I had this discussion with few people from my life who also played it, and we all reached the same kind of conclusion: almost everything points to the tornado destroying Arcadia Bay in every reality, no matter what.

Now let me try elaborate that by pointing out all the hints and plot threads that lead to this conclusion. Feel free to ad your own.

* The whole "100 years" thing. You see this being repeated a lot. Their TV news mentions exactly the same weather/snow storms happening 100 years ago as well. The Blackwell Academy was founded 100 years ago, and the Prescott family rose to power - 100 years ago.

* Nature vs. man - the name "Arcadia Bay" and "Pan". Both these names have significance in Greek mythology. The Greek god Pan lives in Arcadia, which is a land of unspoiled wilderness. There is a famous painting called "Et in Arcadia ego", which, citing from Wiki: "The translation of the phrase is "Even in Arcadia, there am I". The usual interpretation is that "I" refers to death, and "Arcadia" means a utopian land."

* So the Pan estates are being built in Arcadia Bay, again - the Prescotts, representing death and destruction, and Arcadia representing the natural. There is also that whole Native American thing, and spirit animals - it points out to me, personally, that the wilderness was always going to reclaim the Bay.

* The tornado was still coming in every alternate reality. When Max goes to San Francisco, the tornado still arrives. We don't know how and when she used her powers, except few timelapse photos showing things going in different fashion. Even more so in the reality where Chloe is quadriplegic, Max doesn't even mention her powers in her diary, we have no proof that she was using them at all, and the weird weather combined with other signs were pointing towards the storm coming. And in that timeline, Chloe is already dying, Max never gets her powers from saving her - tornado is still going to destroy the Bay if you stayed.

* The Prescotts were building storm bunkers even 100 years ago. That itself is a huge hint, and you have tons of letters proving that. Hell, the Dark Room is technically a storm shelter.

There are probably a lot more hints, but these are the ones coming from top of my head, as you would say. To be completely honest, I think they were planning a plot twist where it was revealed that the Prescotts not only KNEW about the storm (as evidenced by the cut audio in which Nathan is saying exactly this), but they were actively summoning it and perhaps, if not almost certainly, did the same thing 100 years ago, in some sort of cult ritual. It's no coincidence that the Bay is refereed to as being "stuck in time" - there is a lot more going here than it seems.

Personally, I think that a plot twist like that would have been incredible, but for whatever reasons they kept dropping heavy hints like this on us, and scrapped it in the end. It would help beat the "don't mess with the time" cliche - another theme that was stretching through the story, because you would almost certainly except Max to be at fault here, then boom - it was not only her, but maybe more time travelers, not only Prescotts, but what's to say Rachel wasn't a time traveler too, or Samuel? Chloe describes Rachel as being able to blend it with everybody, even people she hated, much like Max can, with the "abuse" of her powers. Samuel - I won't even touch that one, you know what's up, he seems to know exactly what's going on.

It's such a shame that this story has such an untapped potential when it comes to the ultimate thing - the tornado, and it felt overly simplified and rushed in spite of all the clues and hints about other things being responsible for it.

Yes, you can argue that it is the canon they chose in the end, but it is easy to draw conclusion when you're the observer - if you put yourself in Max's shoes, things don't seem so easy and/or black and white. Knowing all these things, from a logical standpoint leaving Chloe to die technically shouldn't guarantee at all that the tornado would be stopped. Again, look at the alternate timeline with dying, handicapped Chloe - we have no idea how, or if Max used her powers at all, and what started the storm, but it's still coming. (Also, if you do sacrifice Chloe, Max could have easily done that by just hitting the alarm or hell, doing just about anything to stop Nathan from shooting Chloe without just sitting there and doing nothing).

So to me, it's a nonsensical ending considering all these hints. Perhaps Max was given powers to stay with Chloe, and in the original concept she was supposed to FIGHT the storm and whoever caused it.

So to summarize/tl;dr : There are heavy implications through the entire game pointing towards culprits other than Max being responsible for the tornado, and even more so that it was always Arcadia's destiny to be reclaimed by the wilderness, but it was scrapped and dumped down all on Max nerveless

I now feel complete. I bought Life Is Strange a while back but just started playing it a few weeks ago. The week that I was playing this game was just amazing and I'm hardpressed to find another game that touched me as much as Life Is Strange did.

Afterwards I went through the post-game depression, in which I started writing my review for the game. Well, I have now been through it all to complete this review and express what I feel about the game.

I hope you like the review, this one was hard to write.
I do feel like I can finally uninstall the game and move on to other things. Thanks for being a great community through it all.

Hey all:
Inspired by Flippy, I decided to post a bit about my own writing here, because I just felt I needed to get it out in the world and share it, and I miss the days of the alt.rec.games.frp and IRC! :-)
Here is the link: http://hujraadjohaansen.blogspot.com/2016/04/hibrid-things-for-your-game-6-vitality.html
I wrote a quick game setting description for my HiBRiD game based on the Square Enix platform/PC game Life Is Strange. It is a low-mid level powered-game with a simple d20-based skills system. It is designed for my game system, but can be easily layered onto any mechanics-light game system (FUDGE, FATE, Savage Worlds, et cetera). I was just so inspired by the ending of the game (I chose to save Chloe...what can I say, I am a romantic), and I felt I just had to write it.
Feel free to lambaste it, add to it, do what you wish; it is a gift from me to you.

Here's the deal. I really like Max's Jane Doe shirt and I really quite fancy one...

...and before everyone tells me to google it or use the search, I totally have. I see that /u/weilschmidtersen has a pretty amazing shopfront  (http://www.redbubble.com/people/scolecite/works/15756412-maxs-shirt-john-doe ) but I'm really struggling to find the John Doe equivalent in a male fitting/unisex shirt in pink. I know it's unusual but hey, it's modern times and every dude needs a salmon shirt - on that product and seemingly every other redbubble top, it's impossible to get that light shade of pink on a male/unisex shirt.

Unfortunately, whereas I'm not huge, I'm carrying ten or fifteen pounds extra so getting a female-cut shirt would just look a bit silly on my frame.

Any ideas? Or am I out of luck on this one?

Hey shaka brahs. So yeah, I bought the game digitally during a sale on Xbox Live, but I loved it so much that I bought the Limited Edition at Best Buy yesterday!
  
I'm really torn now because I want to keep it mint, but I also want to see the stuff inside! What do you guys think I should do?
/////////////////////
What emotional topic that lis covered in the game do you wish was not in the game? (eg. suicide, bullying, drugs)
/////////////////////
This is not the same type of music as the soundtrack but the lyrics of [An Ode To The Nite Ratz Club by The Hotelier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ7zDCb37-Y) (I know, I never shut up about them) reminded me a lot of my two favorite fictional humans, especially their childhood, how they wanted to take over the world, the death of William and how they were separated from each other. There's even a mention of a polaroid !

So yeah maybe it's just me being obsessed by this game and seeing it everywhere but I thought it fit very well. Maybe some of you will enjoy it as well :)

Hello, I wondering, did Season 2 will happens? You have maybe some informations about it? I heard that they confirmed that and then canceled it. Any news about Season 2? I'm waiting for that so much
/////////////////////
I've never been emotionally effected by games or movies or what have you. But this game has touched me beyond imaginable. I chose to save Chloe. (Just look up the main arguments to save chloe and I agree with most of them) In my headcanon: They drive off, have a loving relationship, and have many adventures together. I'm not too worried about the town due to there being underground shelters hinted at. Plus the diner was not obliterated, just badly wrecked. 

I just feel a sad empty feeling that I can't get over. I'm not SAD about the ending, since in my canon they end up happy together. I'm just upset I won't get any new adventures of Chloe and Max. 

I got the game on a Thursday and finished it Saturday, completely obsessed with what was happening next. During those few days, LiS is all I could think about, and I still can't get the experience out of my head. Listening to the Blackwell Podcast right now as I type this.

I hope i'm not too late to join the community. I just feel like I needed to type something out to get it off my chest, haha.

So, recently I bought a 144Hz monitor and I am just wondering if Life is Strange runs on 144fps at all (is it locked to 60?) and does it's physics break when passing certain fps value, or something? Because I am thinking to play the game again (4th time :P ) as it never gets old, so I am just wondering if it works with a 144Hz monitor.

Thanks.
/////////////////////
Just finished the game last night, and I liked it a lot. I feel like it teetered off towards the end, but the twist at the end of Ep 4 and a desire to see how it all tied together kept me going. There were some elements I'm still not sure about though.

**Where did Max's powers come from? Why Max? Why a tornado? Why Arcadia Bay?**

In the beginning I felt like the disappearances, shady behavior, Vortex Club (I mean they're called the vortex club) were going to tie back into why all these strange things are happening and why exactly Max got her powers, but they didn't. They kept the powers/hurricane (tornado?) story line and the Blackwell/kidnapping story line pretty separate. I'm sure they'll explore it in Season 2, but I expected more of an explanation for all this weird shit. Just saying "chaos theory" doesn't do it for me.

**What's up with the deer? Why the lighthouse? What is the symbolism?**

The deer shows up a few times, usually to guide Max, sometimes just to keep a watchful eye it seems. It's not real, as evidenced by the picture you take in ep 2 where the deer doesn't show up, and other than that it only appears in dream sequences. So who is the deer an agent of? Father Time? Or is it just symbolic of Max's innocence, which becomes a bigger theme in later episodes? Same question about the lighthouse basically, why is it important? Just because you can see the whole hurricane and town from there? It reminds me of Alan Wake (was there a lighthouse symbol in that?) and Bioshock Infinite, where the lighthouse had explicit meaning.

**Will Max ever go to the movies with Warren?**

Admittedly this may have been shown in the sacrifice Chloe ending, but I saved her so I didn't see it, but I was waiting to go to the movies with this dude the whole game, which never happened to me.

**Does Max still have her powers after the hurricane?**

I don't think they mentioned it.

**How will Season 2 work?**

The only way a game like this makes sense is if all of your decisions from the first season transition to the second, so if some people end with Chloe dead and some end with the town destroyed, how will these decisions translate to the second season? Either they will have to make two radically different versions of the game (unlikely), or make it largely unrelated to Season 1 (cop-out?).

Really enjoyed the game and I'm looking forward to season 2. Eager to hear what you guys think about all this.

EP1, The Snow: The tornado sucked up the water high enough to make it froze until falling on Acadia Bay. Though it should had been sleet not snow, since the temperature near ground was not low enough.

EP2, The Eclipse: The tornado, which came from west, blocked the sunset, making it looked like an eclipse.

EP3, The Dead Animals: The tornado caused disturbance in the ocean and the air. This is an obvious one.

EP4, The Double Moon: The tornado, acting as a huge water lens, projected the moonlight onto the sky, making another image of the moon. And when it moved closer to the bay, the image disappeared.

I thought about this months ago, but I can't remember if I made a post somewhere or not. 

What do you guys think?

/////////////////////
*No spoilers, just my thoughts and sort of feelings on the VN* 

I'll first just say what I loved about the game. I loved Victoria's route. Almost every 15min I found myself internally screaming "STOP BEING SO TSUNDERE AND KISS ME ;__;" because I always loved Victoria's character and I honestly thought it was very well written in this story. It felt like events happened organically and nothing felt forced. I also **loved** the art. I loved the art and the writing more than the art and writing of the actual game. 

Now, to the part I didn't like. I wanted to play Kate's route but I was **very** turned of from the very beginning. In the actual game, Kate is just a normal girl who has a ton in her plate and doesn't know how to deal with any of her problems, and it's just breaking down under the pressure and stress. 

In the VN, Kate is basically a saint, and almost literally an angel. I don't understand this depiction of Kate outside the fact that she's a christian. I just don't understand this interpretation of Kate's character. I tried many times to play her route but Max kept commenting on how *perfect and majestic and angelical* Kate is and I just don't see it. In my eyes she's just a normal girl. At the end I couldn't finish her route.

Don't get me wrong, I love Kate, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered playing her route, but I just don't like how they try to make her something she isn't in the first place. Victoria was a perfect bitch in the game, and she was a perfect bitch in the VN but they added more depth to her character, and I loved that. Kate's character was pretty much completely retooled, IMO. 

I can't comment on Chloe's and Rachel's route because I haven't played those yet ~~because I'm trying to forget some spoilers I saw on tumblr~~. 

I don't know. What do you guys think? Am I super overthinking this, nitpicking or does *someone* agree with me ~~probably not though~~?
/////////////////////
Bet I can't get the Vinyl at all, huh? Can't find any trace of them any where. Would any one know where I would be able to find one?
/////////////////////
Over the past few weeks I've been doing reskins with TexMod, and changing clothing around and such. The issue I've been having is how limited it is, and you're faced to work within the clothing that the character is wearing, and even if you want to have a character wear shorts, the part of a character's legs that are skin still have a jeans look to them and almost look more like tan khakis then actual skin.

Is there any easy ways to get around this, or am I pretty much limited, same if I want to say have Max wearing a sweatshirt like Brook's?

Thanks.

Not much to say, other than I chose to save Chloe because she reminds me too much of an IRL friend I would do anything for.

Then I watched the Bay ending on youtube and I legitimately cried my eyes out (even though I had spoiled myself the ending and knew that choice was coming). It's the first time I've ever cried over any videogame or movie, so that speaks to the quality of this game

Things seemed so hopeful in that trailer, uplifting music and the hopeful thought of being allowed to fix your mistakes and helping your friends!

Soo, what if you could change your choices?

*cue spanish sahara*

It all ended with my best friend dying in the bathroom anyway without me being able to do anything about it except destroy a town full of people.

Sorry for the rant, I still haven't gotten over this. Even when fun things start happening in my life and thoughts of hope for the future appear in my head, immediately after the first chords of spanish sahara pop into my head and I feel sad and hopeless again, like Max in that bathroom.

Damn.
/////////////////////
Max can't be everywhere at once. Since we play primarily from Max's viewpoint, I'm interested in what goes on outside of what we see from Max's eyes.

For example, the entire span of Max falling unconscious at the beach in episode 5 and going through the nightmare sequence completely skips over the journey to the lighthouse we saw twice in visions in episode 1. Seeing Chloe carrying an unconscious Max up the same path Max originally took in her visions could've paralleled them well, and would make for an intense trip if the obstacles in the second vision (like the boulder and the falling logs) were real and combined with more dangers. 

I'd have liked to see anything of Nathan after his fight with Warren in episode 4. Nathan doesn't get anything more than an offhand comment from Jefferson and a voicemail in episode 5, and I feel like DONTNOD could've done way more of a justice to his character if (among other factors) they weren't limited to showing only what Max sees.

The length of time spanning across when Max is in the alternate timeline isn't covered in the game at all. It would be completely inconsequential to the story, but Chloe apologizing to Max and their decision to use the board of childhood drawings as their pinboard could be a nice addition to the game. It'd be another moment that isn't full of sadness and anger between them, too, which we're sort of lacking nowadays.

What scenes during the week would you add to the game?

Do you wish there had been some larger redemption for Nathan near the end of the game?
/////////////////////
**Spoilers in this post!**  
  
Forgive me if this has been posted or discussed before. While I doubt I'm the first person to think of it, I still wanted to write it out :)  
  
I beat Life is Strange yesterday and it's been on my mind ever since. This morning I woke up thinking about it, and it is here that I started pondering basic existential questions that, in my mind, call into question some of the game, its ending, and so forth.   

First, in order to understand the ramifications that culminate in the final scene at the lighthouse, a question must be answered: are the bizzare phenomena (weather, moons, birds) a result of Max rewinding time, or are they a result of her making choices learned from rewinding time? I'll elaborate on this as I continue.  

I chose to save Arcadia Bay. I've always felt that saving many is more important than a single loved one, and I went in that direction. I watched Max cower in the bathroom while she overheard Nathan kill Chloe. She wept, as she knew what would happen and did nothing. Following that scene, we get the usual montage of photos changing into other photos. One of these depicts Jefferson being led away by the police, which I'll refer back to in a few minutes.  


This morning, I started thinking about the scenarios where Max rewinds time. Obviously it all starts with the bathroom scene. But what about after that? There are minor dialogue options, such as if you choose the wrong person among the options of who photographed the famous "Falling Soldier" while speaking with Evan (after leaving the school following the bathroom scene). There's also instances where you can *only* obtain certain dialogue by using rewind, such as with Brooke, where you can speak with her about the drone, come across as ignorant, after which you are allowed by the game to search her bag, find the box of the drone, and rewind time to have a more informed conversation with Brooke, who then lets you fly it.  
These last two examples are scenarios which I would overlook. In cases similar to the Evan scenario, you could guess correctly, or you could be wrong and just move on. With cases such as with Brooke, you could just accept that you're ignorant and move on.   
This is how it would go if you chose not to use the knowledge you gained from having rewound time. When we see Max travel back in time to let Chloe die, she has the knowledge but chooses not to act on it. So we could presume she wouldn't change the original conversation with Brooke, but how she interacts with Evan would be, I imagine, whichever answer she originally used the first time. Okay. With me so far?  
  
So what about Kate? Because, if Max operates under the theory that she can't use the knowledge gained from rewinding time to change anything (because then it means she rewound time), well then she can't save Kate. She originally did not know that Kate was going to jump, and only arrives at the dorms when Kate is already on the roof. At that moment, she learns that she can actually *stop* time, and does so with the end result that she ends up on the roof with Kate. Sure, she then uses her own knowledge and interaction to talk Kate down (at least in my game) but, in the original timeline, she was too late. So, again under this "I can't use the knowledge I gained from rewinding time" theory, she has to let Kate die as well as Chloe. I won't go into Episode 3-5, since a lot of those stem from "Adventures with Chloe," and that timeline would be erased. But let's now refer back to Jefferson being led away by the cops.  

We have to assume that, at the climax of the game, Max traveled back to the *original* time she was in the bathroom, ie she wasn't there after she had first accidentally and unknowingly used her power to return to Jefferson's class, run to the bathroom, and save Chloe. After all, if she was in the bathroom for the second time, then she manipulated time, and that invalidates the point of the climax. So I think we can all agree she is back in the bathroom for her first time there. The reason I make that distinction is that, in one possible timeline we see, Max returns to the classroom and uses her phone to text David Madsen that Jefferson killed Rachel, along with all pertinent details. When she does this, it is the first time we see this photo of Jefferson being led away by the cops. However, if Max is back in the bathroom at the end of the game for the first time, then she hasn't alerted anyone about Jefferson. And, the thing is, under the "don't use the knowledge" method of operation, well, she *can't* tell anyone, or else she's still manipulated time. So how then is Jefferson caught?    

When I first finished the game, one of the things that consoled me was that, despite losing Chloe, Max got an extra week with her that she otherwise would not have had, and together the two of them solved the mystery of Rachel's disappearance that they otherwise would not have solved. But that goes out the window if Max can't use her knowledge, because then Jefferson still gets away with it all, and Rachel isn't found without a tip-off from Max, but that means using her knowledge gained.

The *only* way I see this still happening is if either Nathan confesses after being arrested for Chloe's murder, or if Jefferson himself confesses. We do see what appears to be a photo of Nathan and Warren's scuffle turn into what I suppose is [Nathan next to an orange jumpsuit](https://youtu.be/d4XeTzBtCTk?t=38m), immediately followed by Chloe dancing turning into the photo of Jefferson being led away. So maybe that *is* what happened and what we're to take away from that. Although, Chloe specifically says, "[without your power, we wouldn't have found her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4XeTzBtCTk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=30m54s)" in reference to Rachel.  


Again, this is all with the "lesson learned" in the finale being that Max cannot use the knowledge she obtained from manipulating time. And it's presumably why she just cowers in a corner while her best friend is killed by Nathan. And, under that belief, she basically has to hope for a confession from Nathan or Jefferson, or else Rachel will never be found and Jefferson will continue with his machinations. I think that's a very important point. If Nathan never confesses and implicates Jefferson, and Max can't use the knowledge she gained, then she has to sit in his class and watch Jefferson knowing what he's done, as well as if another girl goes missing. That's a very difficult, "gee I hope it all works out" to take, isn't it?  
  
So what if that's *not* the lesson learned? That lesson means it's the choices Max made that resulted in The Universe going haywire. It also means she basically has to "trick" The Universe into believing that she never time-traveled. Because, as Chloe says at the lighthouse "all those moments between us were real." So, even though Max is traveling back to the bathroom via the photo, well, she's still using her power just to do that, and the things that happened still happened.  
  
One thing that I think is important to note is that what happened in the bathroom that started the mess wasn't even her fault. Max didn't intend to rewind time when she reached out in the bathroom; it was a normal reflex. So then, following that, we get back to the question I mentioned at the start of this: was it the fact that she rewound time that began messing with the weather? Or was it using the knowledge gained from that?  
  
Let's say it's the fact that she rewound time. If that's the case, then that means it's *not* from the knowledge we gained in doing so. As such, Max could basically save Chloe in the bathroom and text David Madsen the details about Jefferson, OR she could relive nearly the entire plot of the game and just use her knowledge to not manipulate time.  

Think about it: when Max returns to the bathroom at the game's finale, she can still save Chloe by using the fire alarm. Subsequently, she could even speak with Brooke about the drone and fly it, because she wouldn't need to rewind time as she would still retain the knowledge about the type of drone it was. She could save Kate by making her feel loved (as she does in the same timeline where she texts David Madsen) instead of manipulating time. She could stop Jefferson/Nathan (via text to David Madsen or otherwise) and find Rachel's body. She would never have to tell Chloe (or anyone) about the power she has (assuming she still has it; we never find that out when she returns to the bathroom at the finale), so she wouldn't need to play the diner game with Chloe. She could either refuse to go along with Chloe's adventures, or do so but not manipulate time (ie they never break into the Principal's office and they get caught in the pool). Also, Max only discovered she could travel through photos by accident, but now she knows this. So, basically, she just doesn't do so when Chloe is all pissy and drops her off at Blackwell without a word. That way, she doesn't affect the timeline (no paralyzed Chloe scenario). I'm not sure if she can obtain Frank's RV keys without time manipulation, but so what? There's nothing vital in there, other than Chloe learning Frank and Rachel were closer than she was aware. At the junkyard at the end of Episode 4, if Max is going through the motions of the plot, she need only alert Chloe before Jefferson shoots her (as well as avoid a needle herself). The entirety of Episode 5 need not happen in this case but Rachel is still found, the dark room found, Jefferson caught (or killed in self defense), Nathan as well, and Chloe is alive.  
  
Now, I realize that Chloe's appeal to Max at the lighthouse climax was that she's supposed to die. So maybe Chloe dies another way, one which Max has no idea is coming, but -- by using her knowledge gained but not manipulating time after returning to the bathroom -- Max can prepare herself for it, given the conversation at the lighthouse. And, in the process, she saves Chloe in all the ways that she knows how, she stops Jefferson/Nathan, and finds Rachel. Conversely, the other method -- where she doesn't use her knowledge gained at all, nor rewind time -- means that Chloe dies, Kate dies, and there's a possibility that Rachel is never found, Jefferson never caught, and more victims as a result.

Some serious detective work is at hand. And I'm ready to bust some butts and take some names. In the name of JUSTICE! So glad there was at least a little less emotional trauma here. I needed a break.

If you'll stick around for a brief minute, I want to mention something before you go into today's new episode for Life is Strange. 

You guys really are the best part of my day. That being said, I want to be as open with you guys as I can.

In less than two weeks you guys have supported me in ways I never imagined. I am about to break 50 subs which I honestly didn't think would happen for at least a month. You guys did that, and it is because of this consistent support from you guys and girls that I am now calling you to arms. If you guys like what I am about, what I stand for, and what I make, please take the time to share the channel with your friends, family, coworkers, or whoever. Spread the channel and make it grow into something big so we can impact the world together. It's you guys that will make this channel capable of great acts of service and kindness. You viewers are the ones with the power to make this grow. Like every video you enjoy, comment on every video you have any thoughts on. It really does make a difference in how the channel grows. Build a community with me so we can all be one massive spearhead of good that can change lives for the better. Once we break 100 subs I will be doing livestreams on the weekends so we can have some more fun together in addition to the daily videos. I will never ask you to like or subscribe in my videos. I only want you to do so of your own desire, not because you felt lead to because someone told you to. I will however call you to action to help make this channel be the force of good I know we can be. To those of you doing that already, thank you. 

For those who don't know what I am about and what my goals are for us feel free to watch this.

Hey guys,

Definitely late to this party, but I thought it was a great game save for two things. Definitely would appreciate your thoughts!

1) The going through doors and stealth parts at the end of the game were annoying and didn't fit with the rest of the game, in my opinion, but not a deal breaker.

2) THE ENDING - for me the problem was the two choices made all of my other choices in the game seem inconsequential. 

-Save Chloe: everyone else dies, including my plant, and all the other people I interacted with. Ultimately, "actions that had consequences" seem meaningless since everyone gets wiped out.

-Save Acadia: aside from Max growing as a character, then the question is, what's the point of her having the power in the first place since it essentially restores the original time line without her powers.

Ultimately, I wish there were more than two endings (kind of like Chronotrigger). Endings that were shaped based those consequential actions you made over the course of the game. 

Still - loved the game overall and the soundtrack and concept were great!

/////////////////////
I don't actually have any thoughts. I just want somebody to tell me that everything will be okay and Chloe and Max are alive and the tornado never came and everything is fine. 

Oh god why

Hello everyone,

as the title suggests I want to make a collection of small scenes that not everybody might have seen yet. 

Examples: 

* You can talk to Chloe and William at the end of episode 3 after William answers the phone

* Max can rewind after she buys a soda in episode 3 ("Release the kra-can") for a funny line


/////////////////////
So you don't have to say goodbye to everyone so soon. 

I really liked looking at all the optional photos I'd missed (and where I'd missed them), the ridiculously long flowchart for that one interaction with Frank (very cool) and of course the playlist for the soundtrack! Maybe the promotional pack from DONTNOD with the wallpapers and ringtones is a nice inclusion. 

I'll try and compile a nice post with these things and more if there's enough interest.

Hey guys, I really love pictures, which we can found in game. I mean, when Max was on trip as a child, when she was at home, when she and Chloe wear pirates suits. I think you know what I talking about, pictures, photos from their lifes, which we can find. I dont think about photos, which we can do in game, like squirrels or model skeleton.
Here's my question. You know maybe where I can find them? To download or something? I wondering, is that possible or they are only in game? 
Greetings.

Some folks requested an AMA, so here it is. 

A bit about us and the project: LiSVN is a free fan project that we started working on last October, with a budget of 0 dollars and a core team of 12 (4 writers, 4 artists, 1 musician, 2 programmers, 1 scripter/qa). It initially started as a small little thing, but then the team wanted to actually make it good, so here we are 6 months later. 

The VN includes 150k words across 4 routes, 52 sprite images, 25 backgrounds, 8 contest photos, 5 bonus photos, achievements, a journal, and other stuff that i'm probably forgetting. A lot of stuff though.

If you want to check out the project, our tumblr is [here](http://loveisstrange-vn.tumblr.com/post/142072569900/after-a-wild-journey-lasting-roughly-half-a-year).

Edit: Staff members answering questions right now: /u/thegadgetfish (project lead, programmer), /u/mcyuris (ending, journal, credits artist), /u/mjrrgr (rachel writer), /u/eiprej (victoria writer), /u/kunaike (sprite artist), /u/panty-poison (kate writer), /u/mostlymilkwood (scripter, qa, gift &amp; achievement artist)
/////////////////////
Mark Jefferson? In one of my playthroughs I asked jefferson in the dark room about rachel and he stated that rachel loved him and I confirmed on wiki that the letter rachel left to chloe was actually refering to jefferson and not frank since Rachel Left frank for being violent thowards her whilst on drugs.
/////////////////////
So I did love the story. Hell, I love everything about the game. Especially I love the design. The graphics, the animations and the details. the whole game has a level of careful craftsmanship and soul I've yet to experience elsewhere. This game felt more real to me than any AAA-games I've played aiming for photo-realistic graphics.
So I'm looking for something similar. Obviously a 3D game, not too fast paced. Genre doesn't matter, but hopefully a good story or good gameplay. If it has both I'm sold.

Things I've played: Telltale games (walking dead, wolf among us etc)
Things I don't have: A console. 
/////////////////////
Which character's hobby in game was your favourite? 
Max's photography, Warren's science,  did you like flying drones? Or was Chloe's weed your favourite ;). Obviously you can pick anything I left out
/////////////////////
[EP4 SPOILERS] SORRY! Mistyped!!!

I have no words for this. I'm not even going to go into it. I dont have the emotional fortitude to write about it. Just watch... 

If you don't that's fine. Just know that I am ready to climb in a hole and feel nothing for forever for what I did.

As always, your continued support means the world to me and the community. And I hope that you guys will join me on this adventure to help make any difference we can in the world together. Love you all.

Unpopular opinion incoming: 

I loved LIS, loved the possibility to 'romance' Chloe, I'm gay myself - so I recently downloaded love is strange and started playing. 

I totally get why it's been made and all but I find it wayyy too cringe  to play past the first like 5 minutes.

Am I alone in this? 
/////////////////////
If it wasn't for Episode 5.  
  
  
Let me start off by saying a few things. I really dug the atmosphere, characters, and art design of the game. It captured the *memory* of what you think your childhood/high school/college years were like, both the ups and downs, the quiet moments and the high intensity situations. It captured the feeling of nostalgia for me. Overall, where some of the dialogue, animation, and plot points sometimes were a bit poor, the overall experience was an emotionally compelling ride up till Episode 5. So why did the ending fall flat for me? Two major reasons were because...  
  
  
1.) I couldn't save Kate in Episode 2. I played everything by the books up to that point. I tried not to step on too many people's toes. I tried to judge each situation as a PLAYER, rather than a character, as I knew in the back of my mind that every choice might spell disaster down the line. I didn't intervene with David and Kate. I didn't erase the video link as to not upset Victoria. I did answer Kate's phone call and comforted her in her room (and found all the clues about her family). However, when it came time for Episode 2's ending, I chose the logical options, not the emotional ones, and I failed. That, over everything else in this game, was my biggest emotional wrench and mistake. 
  
  
2.) I didn't attach to Chloe that much. I understood her character, her struggles, but personally, she wouldn't be someone I would want to associate with in real life. This inevitably carried over to how I viewed her in-game, no matter what Max was thinking in the moment. Simple put, Chloe was trouble - the shenanigans that she constantly got herself into were rather annoying (ie, the developers having to think of ways for Max to use her powers - the Train rescue and Swimming pool escape come to mind). So by the end of Episode 4, my mind was still stuck on the fact that I failed to save Kate rather than Chloe.  
  
  
These two reasons led me into Episode 5. I was completely fine with the mechanic of Max’s photo-time travel abilities being the main game play feature, as it validated Episode 3’s flashback for me and seemed to be “smart” way to get her out of her captivity. However, an interesting thing happened. The more I jumped back and forth in the story, the less I started to care about the “main” timeline. I saw poor Kate alive again. I gave her a hug. I saved her. Then I saved the school. Then I didn’t. Then I did again. It kept going back and forth until the emotional build up I had from those first four episodes was chipped away. It was literal exhaustion, much like Max was feeling, but for the story and game itself.  
  
  
Then came the final choice. You probably already guessed what I picked. It’s been discussed many times on this sub, debated fiercely, that the final choice is supposed to represent “fate showing Max that she can never intervene” or that “choosing something you love means sacrificing something else”. What I saw was a cop-out option that the developers shoe-horned in at the last minute (maybe it was the fact that half the lip sync in Episode 5 didn’t even show gave me that feeling) to try and add extra drama at the end. The crisscross of time lines, mixed with this final undesirable pick left the ending feeling undeserved (and as has been talked about here before as well, like a waste of your time). I saved Kate, a person I didn’t care that much about died, and the final message of the game was “you think you could change things? [Wrong!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnP8nfRB4g4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m8s)”. None of your choices mattered, and even if you picked the ending in which you chose to “defy fate”, you ended up killing hundreds of people for a selfish reason. “The Last of Us” got that choice and ending right. “Life is Strange” didn’t. But that’s just my opinion. What’s yours?
/////////////////////
What did you think of the twist at the end of season 4? Did you catch any hints of it before it happened?
/////////////////////
I'd love to see one of the top post for the all time of this thread have to do with helping people.  This game has had a tremendous effect on a lot of people and anyone who will play the game will feel similar to how we have all felt.  A while ago I wanted to tell a redditor on an askreddit thread about this game with a link to how its helped people connect but I couldn't find a good post in the top all time (usually the first place I check when I visit a new sub) to link so I gave up.  I'm sure this game has helped plenty of people so far but it'd be nice to know that it still is helping people even after I stopped checking here regularly.

Could we get people to upvote a suicide awareness thread?  A thread to raise awareness about physician assisted suicide? or something smaller about how this game saved someone's friendship?

/////////////////////
This is not a complaint by any means. But from all the posts here, I feel as if I'm the only one that did not see or playout Max being lesbian/bi. 


I can't be the only one that's surprised on how much content posted is relating to that. Is anyone else in the same boat as I?
/////////////////////
In Life is Strange there poses many questions that leaves me thinking, why was this apart of it in the first place?

Questions about the old lady Max encounters. Where did she go? Did she know about the storm?

Why couldn't we have found Rachael Amber alive? I know it advances the plot to find out how senile Mark Jefferson is, but couldn't the story have been told by keeping her alive too? Maybe it could've been more intriguing? 

Why is it even an option to "go ape" with Warren when you never go? It just makes Brooke jealous. 

The Prescott Family. I would have liked to see more of them instead of hearing about how terrible they are as people. 

Many more questions in the storyline, I just don't know what to ask as of now.

Give me your thoughts, answers, and other questions you may have.
/////////////////////
And Max and Chloe made better drawings when they were 13/14... I wasn't satisfied with [the result](http://imgur.com/gallery/Fmyq9Ap/new) but I don't think I can do better.

So I thought I'd use it as a reminder that we have EXTREMELY talented artists in the Life Is Strange community and that we should all be thankful for that :)
/////////////////////
I started therapy 3 weeks ago. I had a major depressive episode on top of several months of mild depression. I left a relationship that wasn't bad but wasn't good - I lost myself to him and forgot everything about who I am as a person by myself. I had no hobbies, I had no motivations. I sat in my room alone most days and got online, because that's all that I wanted to do (and even doing that required a lot of effort). A week later I moved to the city, found out I got a new job, made some new friends and started getting my life back.

I'm in a better place now. Therapy really helps. But it's just the start of my journey.

I never related to the story until the very end. I went with bay - it was the only choice for me. I didn't like Chloe, I didn't like Max - something just did not settle for me. Their relationship felt off, one note. I'll explain why in a bit.

Afterwards I went online and watched the bae ending. It wasn't until then that I just felt hollow. The ending bothered me *so much* - I felt disgusted watching the two of them drive out of the town through all of the rubble and dead bodies, seemingly content. I couldn't get over how strongly I felt that this was just *wrong*. I sat for a good hour just thinking, and then I realized...

I relate so closely with Max that watching the bae ending made me feel disgusted with myself.

Last week in therapy, we got to the root of my issues of self-esteem and feeling like people walk all over me. I'm an enabler and co-dependent. I don't know why yet (we're going into it more this week) but it made so much sense. I sacrifice so much of my life for others and very rarely put myself first. I will actively do things I dislike and ignore the choice I want to make if it makes another person happy, at the loss of my own happiness. I spent months in my last relationship literally only doing what he wanted to do, going where he wanted to go, talking about what he wanted to talk about and waiting for him to set the pace of our relationship. Well guess what? It made my relationship crumble. it wasn't the only factor (he had a lot to do with it), but it was a big one.

But I do this with my friends too, though not as often. I do it with my family. I do it at work and even with complete strangers. Everyone else has always come before me, and it made me a shell of a person. It made me forget who I am as a unique individual. It made me depressed and go through the motions any time I was with someone, because I didn't have anything to contribute myself. I was just the other person's reflection.

I got this vibe through Max and Chloe's relationship during my playthrough. Maybe it was projection, who knows. But I felt like Max did whatever Chloe wanted under the guise of being best friends - that Chloe was the only important thing in the world and all decisions needed to be in her favor. I watched Max's happiness as she saved Chloe time and again and rekindled their relationship, and I wondered, *"What's in this for Max? Chloe? Is that it?"*

I saw them shooting bottles at the junk yard, all gathered by Max while Chloe waited. Max didn't even want to be involved with weapons or shooting, yet she rewound time over and over for Chloe's games. She didn't want her powers to be taken advantage of, yet they were going around town making a game out of it because Chloe wanted to play around. 

Sure, Max seemed happy enough, but it felt hollow. Like me. Like all of this was to see Chloe happy even though it meant Max being taken advantage of (even if Chloe did not intend to).

It culminated in Max literally destroying the world to keep that relationship going. She ripped the fabric of time and space to the point she'd physically injure herself over and over, ditch her friends in favor of Chloe's games, take the heat for something illegal and ruin her reputation, nearly getting herself expelled, all to prevent another person from facing the consequences of her actions. And who even is Max, anyway? I could never get a grasp on her character. Other than photography, what did she like to do? What was her character, her interests, her behavior? She felt so completely bland to me, like a mirror of Chloe rather than her own person.

It reminded me so much of myself and what my therapist and I talked about. I would frequently suffer consequences in my own life in order to save others from the consequences of their own decisions. I took on others' burdens so much that it became a burden on my life, ruining my reputation with several people and ending essentially every romantic relationship I've ever had.

This game helped me realize that I can't continue shouldering other people's issues at my own detriment. Chloe's death in bay signified that it was her time, and there was nothing Max could do to prevent that. Chloe made her own decisions, and as unfair as it may be that she had to suffer in that way, it was still a result of her actions. I was so disgusted with bae because it's like all of those things don't matter, and the two of them were off to a life full of the same enabling behaviors at the detriment of literally the entire town. 

I can't continue letting myself suffer and letting others suffer all for the sake of one person. I can't sacrifice myself to that extent anymore. I have to find a better balance between selflessness and selfishness, and I need to let other people live the consequences of their own choices, whether positive or negative.

SERIOUSLY??? This game is really making me chose between quadriplegic chloe with her dad, and no dad but emotionally fucked up??? Why can't I just be happy? 

God damn it! Fuck me... anyways... here's a new episode from my channel. If you stick around to the end you'll see me break down like a blubbering idiot. Thanks for the support guys. Love you all. I'm going to cry at my desk for the next 2 hours while I play the next episode...

It is called ERASED. I just started watching it yesterday and it got me hooked. Because...it feels like Life is Strange. Each episode has a crazy cliffhanger and...time travel. Just came out in January and seems to be an anime on the rise!

"When tragedy is about to strike, Satoru Fujinuma finds himself sent back several minutes before the accident occurs. The detached, 29-year-old manga artist has taken advantage of this powerful yet mysterious phenomenon, which he calls "Revival," to save many lives.

However, when he is wrongfully accused of murdering someone close to him, Satoru is sent back to the past once again, but this time to 1988, 18 years in the past. Soon, he realizes that the murder may be connected to the abduction and killing of one of his classmates, the solitary and mysterious Kayo Hinazuki, that took place when he was a child. This is his chance to make things right.

Boku dake ga Inai Machi follows Satoru in his mission to uncover what truly transpired 18 years ago and prevent the death of his classmate while protecting those he cares about in the present."

/////////////////////
It's been a while since I played this game, its effects have more or less faded on me. I came across Adum Plaze's (from Your Movie Sucks) playthrough recently, and he criticized the game a LOT for its dialogue and writing.

Now, had this been around and I watched it, say 4 months or so, I'd be pretty upset. But looking at the game again without the fanboyish passion I had for it then, there are a lot of writing flaws and inconsistencies that I can't bring myself to deny. It's really interesting, looking at the game from a critical perspective. It's like I've been only taking too much out of the game from what the game *tells* me to take out of it, what it tells me to feel. That's not necessarily bad, but it did make me somewhat oblivious to some of the flaws the writing had. After so much exposure to the praise this game received from the subreddit, it really is enlightening to look at it from a critical persepctive, and consider some of the things we might've not considered.

Anyway, this might be upsetting to those who love the game, but I agree with a lot of what's been said in this video, and the rest of the playlist. This is no way an attack on the game, because I absolutely love so much about it, but I also think it's important to look at it from the other angle as well.

Hello there. Is there anay sounds or effects from game to download? I dont want soundtrack, just effects like messages, or texts used by characters
/////////////////////
What was the hardest decision for you to make in the game? Did that decision change the storyline majorly?
/////////////////////
So I watched [Chronicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD0DshFbmxA) for the 100th time and it reminded me a lot of Life Is Strange (Pacific Northwest+teenagers+superpower that makes your nose bleed). I never saw it mentioned here so I thought I'd share it with you :) 
/////////////////////
Everyone in here loves the soundtrack, so I figured this wouldn't hurt. Here's some stuff I like that I've found to be at least a tiny bit similar in feel to (parts of) the LIS soundtrack - it's been a while since I played though, so don't hurt me if some of these tracks/albums don't fit too well.

ALBUMS: 

* **Elliott Smith - Either/Or**: a classic, for every fan of sad-sack indie folk. Oh, and he's from Portland.   
[Rose Parade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gOqqZAVID8).
* **Nick Drake - Pink Moon**: another classic and just an all-round fantastic album.   
[From the Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2JjJPDz3EE).
* **Kings of Convenience - Riot on an Empty Street**: just listen.
[Homesick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oll6UfK6iUg).
* **Grouper - Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill**: mellow acoustic guitar stuff smothered in a blanket of field recordings and reverb.
[Heavy Water/I'd Rather Be Sleeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NynkFRDlWtY).
* **Ben Howard - Burgh Island EP**: you might know him from upbeat stuff like Keep Your Head Up, but this EP explores a much more intense side of his sound.   
[Esmeralda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYUKsRL-YBM).
* **We Are Augustines - Rise Ye Sunken Ships**: cinematic indie pop album, contains some pretty draining stuff.   
[Headlong Into the Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8pBCpvqLZ4).
* **Anathema - Weather Systems**: lovely album by a former prog rock band, featuring lots of moody, largely acoustic stuff.         
[The Gathering of Clouds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ShXj4MT20). 
* **Hammock - Chasing After Shadows...Living With the Ghosts**: you'll dig this if you enjoyed the more long-winded instrumental stuff, like Kids Will Be Skeletons.   
[Breathturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rENnKECnfs).
* **Sigur Ros - Agaetis Byrjun**: fairly sure that this is the most peaceful album ever recorded. Vocals may be an acquired taste.

I searched this sub for discussion on it but I didn't find anything. IMHO fans of LiS might see some similarities. (Side note I saw it on HBO streaming)
/////////////////////
I cannot find any of these in the web. Does anyone have them? [I mean these and all the other ones](http://orig11.deviantart.net/d949/f/2015/295/c/7/screenshot__149__by_intellectualpredator-d9e0o1m.png) Black and white ones, including Max and Kate. [And also a red one.](http://i.imgur.com/GNRhcpW.jpg)
/////////////////////
After I finished I realized there was a hole in my heart from the game, and to fill it, I listened to music that helped me through tough times before. I wanted to make a music compilation for people who seem lost and don't know what to do, after they have finished the game. I have found that nothing does the game justice quite like music, as it carries meaning for us all. I need all of your help with this. Feel free to post links to/names of songs, albums, bands, playlists, etc. that have gotten you through the tough times after finishing LiS. Compiling this would be awesome and help everyone find new music! (P.S. please refrain from posting the LiS soundtrack as that can be easily found) 
TL;DR: This is a place to post music that helped you get through anything after LiS
/////////////////////
For me: at the end of episode 4, just after Chloe is shot and Max is injected, I thought "holy shit, someone who knows how to stop Max from rewinding. Maybe the one who gave her the power?" 

And then "holy shit, *Jefferson* gave her the power?" 

But no, the origin was never explained :(
/////////////////////
So I found these videos on YouTube made by someone calling themselves "Taylor Christensen" and I figured they deserved WAY more views.
I found them hilarious and they really helped me with post LiS depression. If you have some spare time, I strongly recommend them!

Hey there!

I'm one of the hosts of [Red Pages Podcast] (http://redpagespodcast.com/) - a show where we talk to people who produce creative content (mostly game developers) about their work.  We're pleased to announce that this week we're scheduled to have Christian Divine, the writer on Life is Strange, as our special guest!  One of the chief mission goals of RPP is to connect these creators with their fans, so we always make sure to open our guests up for questions from the community.  To that end, if you have a question for Mr. Divine, please feel free to submit it to us, either by posting in this thread or via our handy-dandy [contact form] (http://redpagespodcast.com/contact).  We can't promise that every question will be read based on time constraints and content of the questions, but we'll do our best.

Whoh whoh, you may say, that's cool and all, but who are you clowns and why should I trust you to do a good job?  Fair enough, we say.  That's a reasonable question.  We're a small group of friends who have been doing these interviews for years now - our guests have ranged from folks like Edmund McMillen (creator of Super Meat Boy) and Chris Avellone (the writer behind games like Fallout: New Vegas) to authors like Andy Weir (The Martian).  I personally am a game developer working at a company called Twinbeard on a game called Frog Fractions 2, so we have professional insight into the industry as well - we're not just fans.  We try our hardest to get these things right and do a good job, even if maybe we don't always succeed :)

Anyway, we plan to record on Wednesday, April 13, so please submit your questions before then - ideally about a day before so Christian has a chance to look over everything and prepare!  Thanks :D

PS: Christian Divine also did writing for Warren Spector's classic game DEUS EX, John Romero's DAIKATANA comic book, as well as multiple film projects, so feel free to ask about these things as well!

/////////////////////
**[Run by Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psiILfa-G1c)** is a great anthem for the Bae &gt; Bay ending IMO.  Some parts of the song don't relate perfectly, but the overall somber vibe and a majority of the lyrics create the scene of Chloe and Max escaping Arcadia Bay after the final choice, in my mind.  Here's some example lyrics to share how this song reminds me of LiS from Max's perspective...

------------

&gt;Cause we've got nothing to say... just the beating of hearts like two drums in the gray.  I don't know what we're doing, I don't know what we've done.  But the fire is coming... so I think we should run.

-My favorite part... reminds me of Chloe and Max watching the storm on the cliff &amp; in the final scene driving through the destroyed town, completely silent, and then driving away passed the Arcadia Bay sign.  They don't know the full gravity of what they've just done (or who they've lost), but they still have each other, and just need to get the hell out of there.

------------

&gt;And we will step outside, checking out the coast is clear on both sides, cause we don't want to be seen.  No, this is suicide, but you can't see the ropes.  And I won't tell my mother, it's better she don't know.  And he won't tell his folks, cause they're already ghosts.  So we'll just keep each other as safe as we can until we reach the border, until we make our plan to run, run, run, run...

-Here I picture Max and Chloe held up in some hotel outside of town.  Obviously no one knows that Max caused the storm, but she still has some paranoia.  It would be understandable after the trauma she just experienced to not be 100% rational.  The suicide bit speaks of how they've essentially ended their old lives (hence the "you can't see the ropes" part, because they're still actually alive).  The next part is Max being unable to contact her mother due to the guild of what she's just done ("it's better she don't know").  The next sentence in reference to Chloe's family, who they assume to be gone from the storm ("they're already ghosts").  They're trying to keep each other safe and get as far away from town as possible ("until we reach the border").  Maybe they're headed for Canada?  Or even just a state border.

------------

&gt;Will you stay with me, my love, for another day?  Cause I don't want to be alone when I'm in this state.  Will you stay with me, my love, 'till we're old and gray?  I don't want to be alone when these bones decay.

-Pricefield!!  This is pretty blunt.  They can't be alone with the mental state they're in, they need to be with each other for comfort.  And now that they have no one, they need to stick together forever ("til we're old and gray" / "when these bones decay").

------------

Please tell me what you think!  I've seen some Daughter posted around here before (especially Youth), so I know you guys have great taste already. ;) Hopefully some people will enjoy this song and start to relate it with LiS like I have!  It just makes the song even more enjoyable and precious.  Enjoy!

If you are looking for something new to play after LiS, I would highly recommend Kentucky Route Zero. 

It's an indie game released in five acts (three are out) with like 1-2 years in between. 

It looks and plats like an old school point and click adventure, but it manages to scratch that Lynchian itch that LiS also did somewhat. 

The atmosphere and story is great, on of the most unique games I've ever played. It might not feature characters as great as LiS, but if you can get over it's simple looks I think you will have a great time. 

At least it managed to get my thoughts off of LiS for a few hours at least ;-)

It's 9:15 PM on a Friday. I'm home alone in a messy 1 bedroom apartment, and I've had about 7 or so beers. Currently trying to focus on a photo of me and my ex during happier times so I can go back and do things differently. C'monnnnn damniittttt
/////////////////////
Half way through Episode 5, honestly it keeps surprising me every moment 
/////////////////////
Life is Strange is a game that i can't really explain how i feel about it. I both love it and kinda dislike it at the same time. I remember the first three episodes were really nice and interesting, but in episode 4 it got very dark. I remember playing the first episode in May-June i guess(?), and after it it instantly hooked me up. I remember staying late at night for the new episode to release and i was like 2-3 hours later with them, because i only had episode 1 in my Steam and the rest i pirated them and trackers published them little bit late (My physical Limited Edition for the PC version got delievered in Wednesday tough, because i needed to buy this masterpiece anyway). One of the most emotional and sad games i've ever played, along with The Walking Dead series. Most depressing episode was  4 in my opinion. Tough being really sad, i didn't cry like most people for some reason, maybe most of them were females (because yea, females are really more emotional than males)? I am glad that episode 5 wasn't released on my birthday (23-rd October, 3 days before turning 18, and ep5 came in 20-th) After episode 5, i disliked the game very much, not because it's a bad game, but because it was toooooooo sad and depressing, and i don't like such games. movies, music and so on. Also, just a little bit ashamed of having such diferent game along with those f***ers like that :D (I am sorry if my English is too bad, not my native language, but i hope you can undestand me. Also sorry for the bad quality :D) http://imgur.com/XnmUZu4 . 
/////////////////////
Which character do you think most relates you in terms of hobbies and why? Did that make you like the character?
/////////////////////
I mean, to me Life is Strange offers something different than a game or series. So I've been saying ''have you seen LiS?'' when i ask.

So what is a more accurate viewing genre based on this? I've glanced on the word epilouge (sorry if i said that incorrectly), I haven't checked the definition, but just a suggestion. 

What do you think?
/////////////////////
I can't find a proper conversation in this sub about the nightmare scene!  I thought it was fantastic, and bordered on horror at some points. The part where you're in the snowglobe and get those texts was disturbing!  Except when pompidu texts you asking for snacks xD what do you guys like / dislike about it?
/////////////////////
Yesterday, I saw a similar post to this and some of you folks said that listening newcomers is great. I have no friend to talk about this game either, so these are my thoughts that I want to share.  
First of all, this is the most powerful connection I had with a character in my life. Chloe. At first, I didn't feel anything special with her. But through the episodes, through some scenes like the pool scene, the railroad scene, the bed photobomb scene etc. I loved her so much. At the end of Episode 3, I watched the screen for about 5 minutes and I always end up crying whenever I watch that scene. And at the end of the game, I instantly choose to save her. Because "It's sad to imagine a world without you" you know. I know myself, if I play this game 1000 times; I would choose to save her in each one. By the way, I watched so many reaction videos to various events in the game on Youtube but I never watched the other ending. I just CAN'T. I don't know how some of you guys choose to save Bay over her. I couldn't watch it and I will never watch it in my entire life. Sadly, I read one sentence that Chloe says at that ending, and whenever I say it in my head with Chloe's voice, I'm crying everytime. "And Max Caulfield, don't you forget about me."  
I'm now playing the game again. Yes the game can be boring a bit after finishing it once but my connection to characters made me play it again. I simply want to hear their voices again. I don't know if I would be able to let go of this game after finishing it once more.  
And, at last, BAE over bay. Always.
/////////////////////
Write down some of your opinions on characters or certain moments and/or choices you made in LiS that you feel are unpopular

for starters, I didn't kiss Chloe in Episode 3

/////////////////////
What a great adventure. I'm all messed up mentally now. I keep replaying some key scenes in my head. I love that a game can invoke these kinds of emotions. Every time I hear Syd ~~Barrett's~~ Matter's Obstacles now I almost tear up.

I think the saddest part personally is that I'll never get to experience it from a never-having-played perspective again.

Just needed to say something to people who have played it. None of my friends have, haha.

Edit: mind was in two different places, lol.
/////////////////////
I don't have time to grow my hair out, what are some good wigs that look like or close to warren?
/////////////////////
I'm too stupid to figure it out by myself so I thought I'd ask this here.

Like Chloe said in the ending, she died or almost died a lot of times after Max saved her in the bathroom, which could lead to think that "death is following her".

But what about William ? He is also someone who Max brought back from the dead with his powers and "death" didn't seem to "follow him" (I hope that what I'm saying has a meaning).

What do you think ?

Was playing the visual novel, Love is Strange, doing the Kate route, and started thinking of stuff and then eventually got that idea for a fanfiction or fanart that I can't do myself since I can't write for shit or draw. The book/movie A Walk to Remember, LiS style. Kate, and the things she had to deal with always reminded me of Jamie, so the idea just popped in my head, could work with anyone probably, but mainly Nathan, Victoria to a lesser extent, or even Chloe. Was just somethin I'd like to see.
/////////////////////
I finished Beyond: Two Souls in one sitting. It's going through the final cutscene now, and I'm contemplating whether it was as impactful as Life Is Strange to me. My conclusion is, no, I really don't empathize with these characters. It might be because the choices don't change enough about what happens, everything seems to still be heading to the same place. There's a disconnect between myself and the player character (Jodie) that just didn't exist between me and Max. By episode four I felt like her actions were an extension of myself in the game world and the game was reacting to that. Obviously it's not that, it's just genius design, but Beyond didn't have that, and it's a worse game for it.

The twist in the end cutscene kinda wrapped it up with an "ah ha" moment (you start the game with an invisible friend who's a spirit or something (Aidan), bound to you against his will by a cord only he can see; endgame reveals [Beyond: Two Souls spoilers](#s "he's your stillborn twin brother and the cord represents the umbilical cord"), and then it shows the main character grieving for her losses, but I didn't really feel anything as Ellen Page monologued about how bad she felt, as opposed to Max [ep5 spoiler](#s "walking up the graveyard hill"), where I felt like a mound of despondent shit. I don't see this game affecting me at all, forcing me to listen to its soundtrack and choke down sobs whenever I hear one particular song, which is probably a good thing, I should probably not take a day off work for a video game again...

As I'm writing I'm trying to pin down exactly what's so dull about Beyond compared to LIS. Is it the soundtrack? There was nothing that stood out, as far as I can tell from memory it was all generic movie music. Is it the real actors? Ellen Page and Willem Dafoe did a good job, because they're actors and it's their thing, and the face animation was exquisite (especially compared to LIS :P), but I was taken out of the ~~movie~~ game because the characters look like their actors, and Dafoe for one is such a famous actor that he took me out of it. Kinda like in LA Noire where the cop from Heroes was one of the suspects.

It could be the love interests. Jodie at various points has the option to express affection, and if you don't ever kiss anyone you miss out on a trophy ("Never Alone"), but none of the love interests really get enough concurrent screen time for the player to really make a decision who Jodie likes more, because of the non-chronological nature of the game. Incidentally, it's interesting how they justify all of the plot points that I thought were contrived for the plot, such as the out-of-order storytelling being an interesting change from the norm and Aidan's inability to travel too far away so you didn't go and explore the maps in essentially 'noclip' mode; but having an explanation for those things by the end of the game is kinda cool I guess.

That being said, it was certainly an interesting game, being a non-religious game centering around the omnipresent idea of an afterlife. Jodie plays paranormal Sherlock Holmes at various points, I think her surname (also Holmes) may be a jab at that. I'm still trying to work out why this game didn't affect me or draw me in nearly as much as LIS, there were a couple moments that were probably meant to, but I'm not fussed by the death of several main characters by the end so it hasn't worked.

addendum: The trouble is that the player character doesn't feel like a real person. I haven't related to her at all, and now she's paused on my tv kissing a guy who she never loved, because she just realised that she loved him when i picked him from two other love interests she didn't love so the game could have a 'happy ending' and she went "of course, it was right in front of me all along". Because it's a movie. It's designed to be a movie, it was previewed at a goddamn film festival, it's a movie with interactive bits and they get to the end regardless of how many quick-time events you miss. I even tried doing nothing in one of the fight scenes, the bad guy ends up getting impaled by someone else, that probably happens regardless. Heavy Rain had more player-choice-changing-the-outcome, and heavy rain was this game's spiritual prequel. They wanted to make an animated movie, they had this game engine lying around, figured they'd make it a console exclusive. I'm not satisfied. Beyond was a waste of my time.
/////////////////////
Hello again ladies and gentlemen.


If you could give any non main character more time and a bigger role in the game who would it be and why?
/////////////////////
(Sorry if the title is a spoiler, but I'm not sure how else to put the question.)

I'm enjoying this game so far but for a variety of reasons have difficulty dealing with suicide attempts.  Other than the end of Episode 2, are there any other suicide attempts in the game and, if so, when do they happen and by whom?  Please feel free to include spoilers about Ep3-5 as they relate to this question as I can't proceed until I know specifically when and how to brace myself, and I figure a story slightly spoiled is better than a story left untold.

Thanks!

[According to TV Tropes on the "Bae" ending](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/YMMV/LifeIsStrange): "Word of God says players get to decide who is and isn't alive as they wish, and that the ambiguity was meant to enable this."

I plan to do exactly this, but unfortunately, TV Tropes doesn't cite their source, and I would like to know exactly what they said. Anyone have any idea where this comes from?
/////////////////////
Song of the moment- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t2H1Ke4MXE (*Kinda fitting to the game, huh?*)

So uh, did a real personal post on here and realized I really enjoy discussing this game and it's a way for me to vent about how much I disliked the ending. That being said, let's get into it. (I haven't found any posts about Jefferson specifically which is why I'm making one)

So did anyone else think Jefferson being the "real" bad guy was dumb? People on here and elsewhere were predicting it since Episode 2. I get it, sometimes your best friends are hiding evil intentions/secrets but it's a total platitude in storytelling anymore. 

I think it would've been infinitely more interesting if Jefferson was more of a tortured [relatable] artist. For example, if he admitted to Max he had previously drugged his models to capture emotion and felt remorse for it or how he is only famous because his photos were manufactured to be popular and not from his actual heart. Like, what if he wasn't just a one-dimensional cartoon villain and was an actual human being? 

I think they missed an opportunity to make Jefferson flawed and damaged instead of a complete B-movie predictable lunatic. 

This goes for Nathan too, Jefferson could've admitted Nathan was crazy and he was too afraid to help him because he didn't want to lose his job or get destroyed by the Prescotts and he saw an incredible artist in Nathan and wanted to make him into what he could never be--an artist who made *real* art, not manufactured or drug-induced.

Not a whole lot to add about the last episode that hasn't been beaten into the ground, I agree it was completely off par with the quality of the prior episodes and felt like a copout, millions of choices and butterfly effects to only amount to two endings that always end--the same. I don't think that is tragic or poetic but hella lame.

TL;DR- Jefferson and Nathan could've been way more complex and interesting characters and yeah, EP 5 was super weak. 

Thoughts?

Bought this LiS poster from Redbubble about a week ago to complete my room. Massive poster, bought a large print with semi-gloss at 1190x669mm. I absolutely love this thing, put it up with fancy expensive command strips and everything.

Around $50 including shipping - 10% with the code RB675843 (although I think the code "APRILBASH" works now for 20% off)

Absolutely beautiful HQ print and arrived three days before expected too (yeah, I was very keen to get my hands on it with all this Post-LiS-Depression and everything going on)

/////////////////////
Okay, the ending themselves wasn't that big of a problem, so much that none of the things you did mattered. You end up just walking through your nightmare and getting a montage of the choices you made.

I also found it hard to believe that Jefferson was the killer. That twist at the end of Chapter 4 felt forced. How did Jefferson get to the junkyard before you did when you ran off while Jefferson was still on the stage?

After that reveal, Jefferson turned into a completely different character to fit the twist. There was never really any sign at all that pointed to Jefferson using Nathan to get drugs and to set up the dark room. The game made you think it was Nathan the whole time on purpose. Might as well say it was the principle the whole time, would've made the same amount of sense.

The whole of chapter 5 is just you doing busy work while trying to find a way back to the light house. Skipping through realities made me not care about the decisions that I made with regards to who I save in the storm and what I say to Joyce in the diner. (Why did I have to even make a decision on whether Joyce goes to David or not?) What was the point of the nightmare? Why did it need to exist at all? Seems like they used the nightmare as a summary of the decisions you've made, so that they can side step giving you any closure to the decisions you've made.

What was the point of the two endings? don't mess with time? don't abandon your friend?

Oh, I also don't buy the out of the blue explanation that her power is the cause of the tornado. I first realized that's what the game was telling me in a dialogue near the end of the game when I was talking to Warren. It's like a show and tell gone wrong and they decided to just tell me "yea this is how it is".

Overall though I do find the game pretty damn good, but nowhere near as good as the walking dead series.

/////////////////////
Something that really bothers me about the story of the game is the eco-disasters. The game wants you to believe that Chloe being alive causes all of these strange occurrences in the town, which could maybe be kind of believable, but they get pretty out there and just stop making sense after a while.

I know one explanation is that all this happens because of Max screwing with time, not Chloe being alive. The issue I have with that is in the alternate timeline, that Max never used time travel powers (if she even had them), but all of this was still happening, so that can't be it.

The snow is the most tame of all of them and is the most reasonable. It happens in 80 degree weather on a cloudless day, which is strange. You would think clouds would at least roll in. It also seems weird that Chloe being alive an extra few hours causes it, but whatever, that's the point at the end of episode 1.

The tornado is where things start falling apart for me. I understand the point of it happening is the butterfly effect and Max changing time caused it. But that seems a little extreme... a giant tornado comes because a girl was alive a few extra days? But fine, it's buyable.

Then there's the animals dying. How does that even begin to relate to Chloe? How does Chloe being alive cause birds to fall out of the sky and whales to get beached? There's no reason she should be making that happen. I just don't see a connection.

Then there's the double moon, the least talked about eco-disaster in the game. It gets mentioned a handful of times in episode 4 and 5 and never brought up again. Again, where is that from and how could Chloe possibly cause that?

But the one that gets me the most is the unscheduled solar eclipse. Things like that don't happen. The moon and earth predictably orbit the sun. If an eclipse happened off schedule, that means the moon literally zoomed forward in its orbit, which would cause WAY more problems than an eclipse. And, once again, how does Chloe being alive cause the moon to *literally shift in its orbit*? There is absolutely no reason a single person walking around on earth should have the moon to move thousands of miles out of alignment.

But that's not all! Let's go back to the alternate timeline. In it, Chloe shouldn't be destined to die in the bathroom on Monday, because she couldn't possibly be there if she's disabled. So, if she isn't supposed to die, then the eco-disasters shouldn't be happening, right? But they are.

Also, Max changed William's destiny, too; he was supposed to die in a car crash, and she made sure he didn't. But in five years of him being alive, nothing out of the ordinary has happened until the week of the game. Why is Chloe causing all of these oddities and William isn't? Is Chloe more important somehow? If the eco-disasters in the week of the game are now attributed to William, why did they take 5 years to happen instead of 5 days?

I have a lot of issues with the ending of the game, but these are some of the bigger ones I have. They seem like pretty big oversights in the plot and just lack any good explanation.

Does anyone have any good interpretations of how or why the eco-disasters happen the way they do?

**tl;dr: I don't get how the eco-disasters are related to Chloe being alive, especially when it comes to the eclipse. Any ideas?**
/////////////////////
... Mr Jefferson. 

So I finished the game the other day, and whilst loving the episode, Jefferson still confuses me. 

Why did he do what he did? The Dark Room, kidnapping girls and photo them? Is he insane? Or is he some psychotic photographer who likes to take pictures of helpless girls? Or has he some other agenda? 

Was there any point to what he was doing? Surely it can't have anything to do with his career? Is it like practice while teaching?

Thanks again guys. I'm stoked for another LIS video tomorrow at 10:00 AM, maybe ill see you there. If not, have an amazing night/day! :D

So, I've been trying a million different medications through my doctor for depression/ADHD symptoms with no luck. I binge eat with no end in sight. I have anxiety attacks seemingly at random that make me feel like I'm dying or don't exist. I get laid off after working for a year and getting promoted half way through that year. I tell my ex who i've been crushing on the last four years I still liked her and she told me she didn't like me as anything but a friend. I took a medication my doctor prescribed to me to help with my sleeping and it puts me out for 16 hours. I wake up, drive to the gas station to get a drink and wake up and as I pull into my driveway with rain pouring down this song comes on. 

Realization happens and I end up crying in my car for awhile.

I don't know how much relevance this actually has to Life Is Strange other than it being from the soundtrack and bringing back feelings I had during the game. I just felt like this might make others going through similar things feel better. Thanks for reading

Hey folks,

With the DONTNOD Team being in town tomorrow (Thursday) to attend the BAFTA awards with us, I thought it'd be a great opportunity to organize a quickfire Q&amp;A session! 

So fire away with any questions you might have for the team below and I'll respond to any questions I might be able to get the answer to when I sit down with the team over the next couple of days.

Not too sure about the format of the answers yet (text, audio, video) but fingers crossed we can do some short video clips!

I'll be working at Rezzed tomorrow till Saturday (Do come say hello if you're there too, I'll be hanging around the Collective booth!) so realistically I may only be able to get the answers up here early next week. 

-- **UPDATE** --

Apologies for the delay in getting the answers out to you everyone, it took longer than expected to cut the clips together. I've uploaded them to Youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jPeq1NzxF0) and have also answered everyone in the thread below with specific timestamps to their question.

I only managed to grab the DONTNOD devs for half an hour at Rezzed, as they were in and out of interviews at all other times, so I do apologize that I didn't manage to ask all the questions below. I've made a note of a bunch of them though and will see if I can get some written answers perhaps. 

Just to recap, here are the questions and answers along with timestamps on Youtube:

00:03 - How did you pick the music and songs for specific scenes?  
02:00 - Is there an artist or song you didn't manage to include, but would have liked to?  
3:05 - Is there an artist or song you could recommend fans check out?  
4:22 - What kind of influences did you draw from?  
5:20 - Were there any scenes or parts of the story that were cut?   
9:07 - What were the main things you looked for when casting characters?  
13:40 - Did Chloe change very much during development?  
16:00 - Was there ever a third or a different main character?  
17:44 - What would you add to the game if you had unlimited resources?  
21:23 - How did you pick what issues to focus on in Life is Strange?  
  

Thanks for all your questions, enthusiasm and patience everyone! :)

Has anyone else noticed how much Mr. Jefferson looks like Mark Linkous from Sparklehorse? (they have a song in the soundtrack)

He died in 2010 and I think this might have been a nice way of helping remember him and appreciate his work.

Thoughts?
/////////////////////
I've watched like... ALL the popular ones, I think I'm at like 19 full playthroughs watched now.

I just finished "BirdyBoots" playthrough, and it has been by far my favorite (aside from my own :P ).

So, I'm looking for a new playthrough to watch like BirdyBoots', specifically looking for a likeable cutesy girl's playthrough who gets really into it and emotional. Also PRO KATE would be great!

Sorry if this is an odd request, lol.

Thanks!
/////////////////////
Some days are okay, some aren't so good, I listen to 6 or 7 of the songs in the soundtrack daily, I don't have any feelings towards anything else really. Almost every night I have that crying sensation in my throat, but I don't dislike it anymore, it's somehow became satisfying.

http://imgur.com/RnGEd93
Can anyone relate or am I just being pathetic?

EDIT: As a side note, I wish I had more to offer to you guys as a community instead of just discussions, it's just I'm not a great artist and definitely not cosplaying either, some of you are really talented and I feel like I'm undercontributing sometimes, I want to be involved.
/////////////////////
whats your favourite catch phrase from the series, and or do you see yourself changing how you talk because of the game?
/////////////////////
As you've probably noticed DONTNOD have been releasing the 'moments of calm' videos on a few recent Mondays. So far we've had one from episodes 1,2,3 and 4. So I'm assuming that the one of the diner in the storm from episode 5 will be coming out the following Monday from now... But then what? I'm guessing they're trying to keep our attention for something - I'm hoping so at least. So... What do you guys think? Do you think there's a reason? Or do you just think that DONTNOD wanted to release them for some other reason. Or no reason at all. I'm genuinely interested on your thoughts.
/////////////////////
Not sure why it wasn't posted here or why I didn't see it :) anyway here it is!

Just finished watching it and I could help but notice the similarities in plot points. For example the use of the blue butterfly motiff, the main character having the ability to travel back in time, a plot about a serial killer who turns out to be a trusted authority figure. I just thought I would post this to let anyone know who might be interested in stuff that is similar to life is strange.
/////////////////////
Hello internet! I could really use some suggestions here. As most of you here, I am a total fanboy over this game. I pretty much consider myself a strange hybrid of Chloe, Max and even Rachel. 

Max: I have an ever growing passion for art and photography plus I'm extremely introverted.

Chloe: My style consists more of the punk scene. With the right people (Ones I'm comfortable with) I am pretty much a male Chloe.

Rachel: As a part of my punk attire, I wear flannels daily. That's the only thing from Rachel.

Anyways, what I'm asking here is suggestions for the best bracelets and suspenders that match Chloe's as much as possible but can also sustain everyday use. Meaning I am not just using it for cosplay, I am interweaving it into my style. I am mainly looked for her spiked bracelet as I cannot find a decent looking one that matches hers pretty well. Also, the suspenders have shown to be somewhat difficult mainly because there's so many options and the few that I have come across the reviews said that they were very cheap and even came broken etc.

PS: Sorry for rambling nonsense and not getting straight to the point. I just like expressing myself and being descriptive. 
/////////////////////
How did you like the settings where the game took place? is there any place (other than Arcadia Bay, the junkyard, the school, ect) that you would rather have seen the game take place?
/////////////////////
Max has her vision of the tornado BEFORE she saves Chloe and alters time. This would imply that the tornado is coming to Arcadia Bay for a different reason that Chloe. 

Is there any other event that could be the cause of the tornado?

Just wondering in regards to some of the things Max can do in the game what her criminal rap sheet would be since she does commit quite a few crimes in her pursuit of the truth. I don't have much knowledge of American law especially beyond the basics when you get down to state specific stuff so some of this may be way off base but correct me if I'm wrong.

**Episode 2**

* Shooting Frank - While clearly not premeditated Max has a loaded gun aimed at him and pulls the trigger. Also she does shoot at his torso which could indicate intent to kill. Although it was failed it would still be an attempt to fatally injure him.

This *could* be considered in self defence but really it was more in defense of Chloe not herself directly so not sure how well that would hold up/lessen the charges. Would you reckon this was attempted murder in the second degree or manslaughter?

* Damaging the train tracks - Depending on how you "solve" this puzzle Max either damages the switcher mechanism by rolling a cable drum over it or the wiring box by cutting wires. While done to save Chloe, it would still be a criminal act as she has damaged private property of the rail company. Nearest thing I can find is Criminal mischief in either first or second degree depending on how much was damaged.

**Episode 3**

* Breaking into the school - Chloe's statement about how can it be breaking and entering if they have the keys is not going to hold up in a court room as far as I'm aware but even so it's still at least trespassing. Criminal trespass in the first degree?

* Explosive to blow open principal's office - Criminal mischief in the first degree? use of an explosive with the intent to damage the lock.

* Accessory to computer crime (not sure what else this would be called technically) - It's Chloe who accesses the computer records on Well's computer but Max is an accessory to it.

* Stealing the $5000 "Handicap Fund" (read bribe/payoff from Sean Prescott most likely) - Slightly dodgy territory here since the money could have been legitimate but then why is it in a brown handwritten envelope in the principal's drawer considering the school would have a treasurer who handles all the finances and donations etc. As far as I'm aware this would be classed as a Felony Theft in Oregon as it's over $1000 in value?

* Breaking into Frank's RV - Kinda dodgy ground here since he's a drug dealer but it is his home so technically it's breaking and entering along with theft of his personal property. The theft of his personal property would be a misdemeanor at most.

**Episode 4**

* Euthanizing Alt!Chloe - I know there are laws to allow death with dignity for certain individuals under very specific circumstance but they are done under strict control and are physician-assisted, and technically wouldn't count in the final timeline but would this count as a murder or a manslaughter charge for Max since she assisted in the act? 

* Breaking into Nathan's dorm room and stealing burner phone - Again breaking into school property but on a separate occasion with intent on this occasion. She also steals a phone and other stuff but value wise may be a misdemeanor theft.

* Breaking into the barn/Dark Room - Private property of the Prescott family and is done by damaging the lock and equipment in the barn. (Criminal Mischief?). Max enters both areas and is presumably on CCTV (there is a note suggesting Jefferson had the place wired up for security cameras, although not sure if this was before or it was going to be after).

**Episode 5**

* Stealing Jefferson Car - Unauthorized use of a vehicle without the owner's permission.  She takes his keys and car from the barn once David knocks him out. Again doesn't happen in the final timeline either way but still something she has done.

So to recap

* 3 x Breaking and Entering
* 2 x Criminal mischief of the first or second degree
* 2 x Misdemeanor theft 
* 1 x Criminal trespass in the first degree
* 1 x Felony theft
* 1 x Attempted murder/manslaughter in the second degree
* 1 x Murder/manslaughter in the first or second degree
* 1 x Unauthorized use of a vehicle
* 1 x Accessory to computer crime.

That's fairly impressive for a week's worth of activity and it certainly seems that Max has a bit a of a thing for breaking and entering since most of her crimes involve some form of this. 

There may also be stuff I have missed due to only listing things I observed her do in my playthrough/let's plays I've seen. Feel free to add below any other things you think may be included on her rap sheet.

Obviously either way she won't have to face charges for any of it but it's interesting to me and to Max herself as she even says in game she wonders what sort of criminal she has become.
/////////////////////
How the hell did you guys have the patience to wait for the next episode to release? I see there's like a 2 month wait between each episode. 


I would imagine myself being extremely anxious between each episode just from waiting. I can't imagine the amount of anticipation, excitement, anxiousness, etc. you guys had after completing an episode and waiting for the next one to get released.

I was watching S05E15 of Grimm. I'll try to be spoiler free as much as possible.
[Very small Grimm and LiS Season 4 spoiler](#s "The story is about a fotographer. When the police arrives to his studio, the photo shooting setup kind of reminds of the one that Mr. Jefferson has") and above all, the surname of the guy who gets visited by the police is Caufield.
What do you guys think? Reference or coincidence?

Part two of an interview with DONTNOD. I translated the two questions about endings. If you already know the one with Examiner.com, maybe nothing new but hey, still something. It features both game directors Michel Koch (MK) and Raoul Barbet (RB).

**A word about the final choice. Even if it’s logical considering the entire story, we feel that Life Is Strange’s ending really tends to one of the two propositions. Even if there is the illusion that the player is in charge of his adventure, you have a story to tell. And this story is the same for everybody. In the end, did you have hesitations to propose that final choice? [He chose to sacrifice Chloe]**

&gt; RB: We are always asking ourselves if we shouldn’t have an entire control of the narration, if one ending is better from the other. But there are people who will come to us and tell the exact opposite of what you just told. And the more we hear those stories, the more we are certain that having these two endings was worth it. Well, it’s not that it was worth it: We realized it really depends from player’s experience with the game. We built the game in order to have the final choice. For ones, this choice was logical but for other it was really hard to chose because you know it will have consequences that you’ll have to live with. That’s the main idea of the game.

&gt; MK: It’s really interesting that you tell us you find your choice logical. As Raoul said, for some players, it’s the other choice which seemed natural. And there are people who needed to put the controller on the table for 15 minutes to make their choice. Some criticisms also complain that the binary ending cancels all previous decisions and so they don’t have an impact on the end. I tend to disagree because the way the player will make his final choice really depends by the way he perceived his own adventure through his choices. All the choices, all the relations you created with people and town and particularly with Chloe push the player to make this choice.
We also got a lot of questions, most of them about the shorter ending. Should we say more about what happen to people in the storm? No. If we do that, we’re denying the strong decisions Max and the player did at this point, which is forgetting everything and only focus about Chloe. We really understand that people would have like a less open ending, or would like to know what happen once Max and Chloe left Arcadia Bay. But it’s up to the player to tell what happen next following his choices instead of taking his hand and showing him lot of vignettes about what is next.

&gt; RB: Furthermore, you can put 4.000 vignettes, some people will still be unhappy about it.

&gt; MK: Yes, because it would not be what they imagined.

&gt; RB: It’s like every ending of any book, movie or TV show. There is always a part of you that imagined a perfect ending and it’s not what the creators made. For use, in any case and as authors, it’s the most logical conclusion and it’s the one the game was meant to.

***


**So, you have no frustration about telling a story but not being able to determine the end?**

&gt; RB: That’s also why we made a game and not a movie. It’s really cool that, it’s up to the player. What’s really great about these two endings is that we’re at 50/50. And this is truly amazing. We thought that maybe one ending would be highlighted by players but not at all. Interactivity is why we like making video games and this interactivity is present up until the end.

&gt; MK: One question often asked: What is the canon ending? The true ending is the one the player wants. There is no one being better than the other. For us, the interest of the story was to tell that growing up implies sacrifices, tough choices and accepting it to move forward in your life. In the two endings, Max is doing it. There is no moral or value judgement. It is to the player to have his judgement about his choice. Is he willing to sacrifice everything for the person he loves? Is he making a compromise?  In both case, it is a difficult decision.

———————————–

The edit took me far longer than it should have, almost a month and a half.

I lost my job. Moved. Found a new job. Moved again. Met someone new. (none of this is the edit’s fault.)

There was a brief moment where I thought about canceling the rest of this project. I am glad that I did not. I look forward to writing new material again,starting later tonight.

I re-read the entire story that I have written so far.The second edit came to 85 or 86 pages. The first edit was 90 pages. I didn’t plan that. It was a coincidence that the two edits are so close together in size.

I didn’t change anything in the first four chapters. (aka the first edit.) Those chapters have become eye-sores. It is weird looking back at them. They feel like relics from a time when I  was still grasping at writing straws, even though it was only about 5 months ago.

Chapters 5 and 6 got the largest overhaul. The overall word count of the project grew by roughly six thousand. (That is close to 10%) A large portion of those words were dedicated to flushing out both Kristen and Fernando’s portions of 5 and 6. It became increasingly clear that those characters were going to mean something going forward into the story.

Chapter 7 reads better now. Victoria and David’s motivations and thoughts are more apparent. Added some stuff on their car ride into Arcadia Bay that would set up where the plot might go in the future.

Chapter 8 actually had writing cut from it. Chapter 8 is my largest chapter to date. I got a bit too indulgent with the characters to see what worked and what didn’t. I ended up cutting the drinking story-line. Sunday is already going to be the most bloated day in the story, it was unfocused.

The proposal scene is far better because of the cut, much more focused.

I know now what the purpose of the weekend was. The weekend itself needed to cement Max and Chloe not only as individuals that could survive the mental fallout of the events of Life is Strange, but also as a couple that could theoretically lead happy lives afterward. Both of them know who they are and what they want. When I do a third and final edit much later this year (September?) I fully intend to re-write the first four chapters again keeping that goal in mind. (Those chapters bug me so much. They are chock full of passive voice structure.)

I don’t expect even 5% of you to go back and read through this entire story again, that would be an insane demand. Just know that the new stuff is coming now!

I am deploying a new standard for myself. I am making myself edit each chapter in depth before releasing them into the wild. Hopefully there won’t be a need for another long drawn out edit like this. Each new chapter written should, in theory, be as well written or better than the material present in this second round of editing.

Now I get to write all the fun stuff! Arcadia Bay mysteries and the exploration of extended cast characters. I get to threaten the total destruction of the main characters I spent so long cementing together and give my readers a stomach ache in the process! How Fun! &lt;3

Check out [r/vive](https://reddit.com/r/vive) and [r/oculus](https://reddit.com/r/oculus). I think it would be a perfect game for VR and if they did this and made some kind of free-roam feature so I could just walk around and visit all the places in Arcadia bay, I would probably never leave.

Decided to go no subtitles and having the text in Japanese. I've only done episode 1, but its been pretty unique so far if a bit weird. I have no idea what choices i am picking most of the time or what the characters are saying. The only problems i think i will run into are decisions involving saving Kate and i might have to switch to English for the investigation puzzle. Voice wise they are pretty good, i like Victoria, Kate, Max, Justin and Warren's Japanese voices quite a bit.

Also made a video talking to a few of the characters in Episode 1 around the dorms.

I just finished my 2nd playthrough of the game today, and for some reason when I choose the ending to sacrifice chloe, max doesn't kiss her. In my 1st playthrough, i kissed both chloe and warren and still got the kiss ending. what choice affects the kiss chloe ending?
/////////////////////
Fuck that auto moderator is annoying. Spoilers if you haven't played it.

Has anybody managed to get the golden ending for her? The other three seemed straightforward enough probably because I knew the characters but I keep getting the ending where they discuss their futures in Rachel's room and it ends with them holding hands on the couch.

So I'm looking to order Chloe's Necklace for my German friend and shippment is very expesive from the links I have found and the expense elevates to 42 Euros, which is a price I'm absolutely willing to pay, but I'm wondering if there are any other more economicaly viable solutions ?

Hey there! I was inspired by Koethe to practice my production skills on a new Life is Strange inspired song. This one is called All That Matters. 

I won't talk too much about the meaning of the song so that it doesn't get into major spoilers territory, but I will say that I have loved the metaphor of a beacon for a long time. Finding that one thing to hold onto is essential to overcoming fear, from my experience. My beacon is often as simple as, "I will love." With Max's rewind power and all the things that happen to her throughout the game, I think she would need one too.

Here is the link:

[Kinda funny](http://i.imgur.com/MtjzdvH.jpg)
/////////////////////
Forgive me if this has been asked before, but why does Max destroying her submission photo to the "Everyday Heroes" contest result in her ending up in the Dark Room again? How does Mr. Jefferson even know she destroyed the photo, and when did he burn her diary? Why wasn't David able to get to Mr. Jefferson in time, unless Max never texted him in this timeline?

EDIT:
Thank you to everyone for your replies. Here is how I worked out what happens:

-Max first travels back to the classroom and warns David. She also turns in her photo to win the contest

-Everything is wonderful and happy until the storm shows up. Max goes back to when she took the winning photo before getting time powers and destroys it so she can get back to Arcadia Bay and Chloe. She is so focused on getting back to Chloe that she forgets to warn David this time.

-Auto Max then takes over as "real Max" travels back to the present. She doesn't remember ripping the photo and places it in her journal, instead of ripping it in the infamous bathroom as she originally did. Also Auto Max doesn't warn David as she did before.

-The rest of the game proceeds as it did before. When he captures Max, Mr. Jefferson then finds the diary with the ripped photo and burns it because he's a psychopath. Max thus can't get back to warn David again.

-Then Max chooses Bae so it doesn't matter in the end. :D

EDIT2: I should note this is what MY Max does. Your choices are your own.

Life is strange is very emotionally draining to some people because of the hard topics it hits, what supressed emotions, or thoughts after the game did you have because of it?
/////////////////////
When people ask me why I'm crying at work I'm tempted to yell, "YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND!"
/////////////////////
I sometimes have deep, movie-like dreams but this was a total game changer. I was dreaming about Life is Strange. I actually was in the game. I saw Chloe's car accident and somehow I became a president of the Vortex club. Max was nowhere to be seen but in the end of the party Poe came to me (yes, that Poe from Star Wars) and told me to go back to the "main reality".
Which was still in my dream but this time with Max. I don't really remember much, this dream was too complex but it was beautiful. I had very good time with Max, she reminded me of my best friend from real life. Some jerk guy tried to hit on her and I told her Warren was devastated and me too.
We went to the party (which somehow went berserk, the police and all came) and I knew I didn't have much time so I told her everything. About Chloe's accident and about my feelings for her (just like for that friend from real life). She said "for the first time you are telling the truth".
When Poe came we were both crying and kissing and we were holding hands when going to the parking lot.
I apologized to her for not playing Life is Strange anymore (as you may recall from my last post I had a crysis and felt like this game does not affect me anymore) and told her to live her life to the fullest and find support in her friends.
Sadly we were robbed of probably epic ending because... My alarm rang.

But this dream was so intense... It showed that I clearly still care for this game and I'm sure I will play it again even if I don't have time next week. That was beautiful. Sad too, on personal level.

it's always bothered me that people say Joyce is an amazing cook when they're at The Two Whales, but she's a waitress, not a cook. Waitresses literally don't have the time to cook and wait tables at the same time. Why do people keep complimenting her cooking when they're eating the food that someone else cooked? And why does Joyce wear heels to work? She wouldn't last half an hour on the job while wearing heels. It's like the writers and/or artists have never set foot in a real diner.

Hello again strangers! Before I go in to my obligatory explanation of the song, I wanted to take a second to say thanks to everyone who’s listened to my Life is Strange inspired songs thus far. A big shout out to everyone who requested I be [On the Blackwell Podcast](https://youtu.be/Vav2B-WzG2M) (along with the team for actually having me!) and thank you a million times over to everyone who has helped my original LiS inspired song [Price](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzdSepr9xKA) get over 100,000 views! Seriously it blows my mind and I can not thank you enough! 

&amp;nbsp;

Now with that out of the way…

&amp;nbsp;

As promised in [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/49tbrq/so_i_made_a_very_pricefield_life_is_strange/), here is my Latest LiS inspired song! This time around, (as requested by various listeners when I last asked for preferred song topics) I tried to focus on David. 

&amp;nbsp;

Specifically I tried to focus on his obsession with control, surveillance, and being the “hero”, and how that slowly leads him to do things that loose him the trust and respect of the people he cares about most, up to the point he (potentially) looses them entirely. 

&amp;nbsp;

Free download on the video page, and as always hope you enjoy!

PS: For the record, even though I don’t post it very frequently, I am always open to song suggestions. The idea to have a song about David was suggested to me by others, and I am glad they did, as it turned out it made for some really great inspiration! 

&amp;nbsp;

PPS: My next song is already coming along nicely, and will likely be a bit of a throw back to my more stripped down stuff similar to Price / Sail Away.

Weird af question, I know, but what do you think of her rebellious side? The side that acts out and gets in trouble every once in awhile. I used to see her act like that and been like,"Yup. That's Chloe. And she's fucking amazing." I saw that as her being herself. (And the song,"In My Mind" really helped convince me of this) Yeah, she could probably change for the better in many areas (one could argue) but she's not perfect. She's herself and she's gonna be true to herself all the way. But I watched this podcast with Ashley Burch, and she said something that I never really considered. She said that the Chloe that's rebellious and acts out is a facade and its just her way of coping through all the trauma she went through, understandably. And that interpretation has been making me contemplate if this is truly how Chloe is as a person now or if it's just a defense mechanism. I suppose it is really just up to your own interpretation (Although the fact that this is coming from Ashley Burch kinda makes it seem to be true) and how you see it. But I'm curious on what you think.
/////////////////////
Personally I always pronounced it Ko-Ethe but I heard him pronounce it Koth-E in a video. Which do you prefer? I like Ko-Ethe better.
/////////////////////
... "happy ending"? (I didn't know how else to word this without it being a semi-spoiler so I put the end of the question in here)

Anyway, theoretically, in the "Save Chloe" ending, instead of ripping up the photo of the butterfly- could Max keep the photo and simply switch in and out of realities with and without Chloe (assuming she could deal with the emotional effect of seeing her friend being shot every time she switched, and also if the time travel effect could handle such frequent usage).

If this isn't a viable option, would it be possible for Max to just keep the photo, until her and Chloe grow old together (I doubt they could die of unnatural circumstances if Max still has the rewind ability). And whenever they deem it "the time", Max uses the power and goes back and lets Chloe die, thus returning the world to a reality where Max and the rest of Arcadia Bay, and therefore the world, have grown old, but still would have "lived" in that reality? Am I being too deep or have I left something out?

In short- Max gets longer out of Chloe but loses time with the people she would have been with in Arcadia Bay.

If I'm not the first person to come up with these theories, can someone let me know, I didn't look up any, I just thought of these myself.

Thanks for reading :) leave your thoughts in the comments :D
/////////////////////
Been playing Lis since last November and even though I felt some emotional connection to the game and the soundtrack it never felt more real until this week when a close friend of mine who was like a brother to me died. 
So I took a walk today to be alone and listened to the soundtrack during the walk. It helped me with what I'm going through.
/////////////////////
I'd probably meet Max (as much as I'd LOVE to meet Chloe), and just spend the 10 minutes telling her how heartwarming she is for being so kind to every person whether they were mean or friendly, quiet or loud, happy or sad. Such a quality I have never seen in someone my age.

Also: I'd just like to take this moment to thank everyone on this subreddit for being so friendly to me. Really, I'm so touched by your kindness and understanding, as well as surprised at how many of you have felt the same things as me not only during and after LiS, but also in real life.
/////////////////////
As we all know, Nathan is everyone's favourite character in LiS, seeing as everyone here wanted Chloe to die, Would you rather have had Nathan shoot her at the start so you didn't have to listen to her during the game?


Great youtuber covers this theory here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ


/////////////////////
I would like to preface by saying I'm really glad I read /r/TIFU a [few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/49t5bf/tifu_by_buying_a_game_called_life_is_strange_to/). Otherwise I would have never discovered LiS.

Indie artistic games are not typically my type and I have only liked one other indie story based game in the past: To the Moon. I also ruin experiences for myself by setting high expectations based on reviews and subsequently being let down if the experience wasn't absolutely amazing.

The first part of LiS Episode 1 didn't immediately jump out at me. The hallway intro scene was cool, but high school drama isn't my thing. The central mystery surrounding the storm and Rachel Amber's disappearance was intriguing though and the interesting rewind mechanic kept me going.

Slowly however, without realizing it, I became more and more absorbed in Max's world. The mystery was nice and the characters were well developed. The art direction is great and scenes are wonderfully surreal and genuinely amazing. Voice work is top notch.

But the best part was just wandering around the environment. Listening to Max explore the world and interact with people is a joy, even if it didn't pertain to the central plot. This interaction is what made LiS so much more immersive for me than just a book or TV show. I can go at my own pace, choose my own actions, and explore this unique world. Sometimes, just getting through the day is drama enough.

It took me about 10 days to finish LiS, averaging about 1-2 hours a day. Kudos to Dontnod for making a game where choices really matter, but don't have clear cut answers. The ending scene was emotional, but I wasn't (too) sad at the resolution. My Max had the make the difficult decision of [EP5 SOILERS](#s "leaving behind Chole"), but I was sad because it felt like with the final decision, I, myself, was leaving behind Max.

Her story has reached its natural conclusion; Max has grown up. She has learned not to mess with time and that actions have consequences. The logical side of me agrees with Dontnod's decision of not continuing Max's story. And yet, I would love nothing more than to dive back into Max's world.


**Questions**:

* What do people think about playing the episodes as they were released vs binging all of them at once?
* Is the physical copy worth getting? I'm most interested in the artbook, but it seems much smaller in the pictures that I was expecting.
* How do I rewind time to before I started this game so I can play it over and over without spoilers?
/////////////////////
Hey Strangers and Arcadians! We have some great news for all you. Dontnod has announced that the soundtrack of Life Is Strange will be shipping [on compact cassettes very soon](http://i.imgur.com/jT7bUAd.png). Yes, you read that correctly!

The soundtrack is central to the experience of Life Is Strange, and it shows in the amount of awards it has won. The limited run of vinyls shows a great interest from the fans for alternative media formats. For this reason, they wanted to have something from the old mixtape days - the compact cassette. 
 
To celebrate this glorious release, they will add a bonus track to the mixtape - Hawt Dawg Man's Theme - on the first batch of mixtapes. Take a chance in acquiring this magnificent release, so pre-order the mixtape [quickly](https://twitter.com/LifeIsStrange/status/715856015225278464) before it sells out to avoid total disappointment! 

And to make this occasion even more special, /u/thearcan (Toby Palm), the current community manager, will answer your questions regarding the mixtape in this thread!
/////////////////////
There I said it. I know she isn't real, but just the idea of Kate makes me happy. I hate that she goes through so much bullshit, and I just want to take that pain away. I know it sounds like stupid white knight bullshit, but why do people have to be so mean. Even myself, I'm pretty much an asshole, I make fun of people sometimes for things I shouldn't. Why are we just so mean to each other?

I just love everything about her though. She stands for what she believes in. I hate that it got so bad that she thought she had to take her own life. It's never that bad though. Especially not for someone as awesome as Kate. So what she made a stupid mistake. And she was drugged even, drugged! She wasn't even thinking!

I loved every interaction with Kate. I don't know how I'd be able to play the game if i didn't save her. My heart melted with every interaction between her and Max. I genuinely wanted to save her. Not because there was some ulterior motive for me, not because she was a cute religious girl, but because she didn't deserve what she went through. She deserved to live, to let her true beauty shine through. Even Victoria started to see that in the end. I'm so glad she is alive in my LiS. What some people did for Chloe I wouldn't hesitate to do for Kate, and I don't care how many downvotes I get. I really should sober up lol. Being drunk and on this forum is not a good combination!

Well to all the Kates out there, I love you. Be Strong, you're worth it. You have friends. "Come to me all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."

/////////////////////
Does anybody find themselves connecting what happens in real life to Life is Strange?

I feel like every song I listen to I can trace it back to a character or event from LiS. The same thing goes for some conversations I have. I'll just be talking to someone, and all of a sudden LiS will pop into my head.

Is this just a by product of post-LiS depression? Should I expect to eventually go back to normal? Or should I get used to my new LiS overlords?

# SPOILERS BELOW - READ WITH CARE
/////////////////////
I've been trying to puzzle this out for a while now. Did Jefferson have time to kill Nathan before getting found out in his lair in the final, "convinced-Chloe-to-turn-around-at-the-party" timeline?

Nathan sends his phone message to Max at 9 PM. How late is the party happening? Is he already dead by the time you get there? Jefferson has Nathan's phone by the time the gals leave the party, since they receive the trap text then. Am I correct to say that Nathan is already a goner by that time? It's particularly chilling to think Jefferson killed him barely an hour before finding Max at the party and talking to her like they're the best of pals.

Lastly, Nathan knew he was about to die, he had a phone with him...so obviously he called Max to apologize instead of his dad or the police. "Not in full use of his mental faculties" indeed...
/////////////////////
So a while back, I was watching my favorite YouTuber Jacksepticeye do a Let's Play of Life is Strange. What was interesting was that throughout Episode 5 (and the game), every time Chloe died or almost died, it reminded him of this episode of Lost. And right at the choice where you have to Sacrifice Chloe or Sacrifice Arcadia Bay, Jack started talking about the episode of Lost. He basically said that in it, this one character (We'll call him Rick) kept dying and his friend (We'll call him Morty) kept tying to save him. And no matter how many times Morty saved Rick, Rick would just die again. And it was one of those things where Rick was supposed to die. And what was really interesting was that when Jack was finished talking about it, he basically,in a matter of seconds,said,"Buuuuuuuuut I don't want Chloe to die. So I'ma go with Sacrificing the Bay." And I was thinking that one could take away a very interesting message from what he just did. That message being along the lines of,"Fate may say certain things have to happen, but fuck it. I don't want them to."
/////////////////////
It seems like there's next-to-no concrete information about this on the internet. There's a static theme of Max's journal available to some people, but not everyone. I would absolutely LOVE this theme on my PS4, but I can't figure out how to get it!

I've heard some people say on different forums that they got it from a digital download, from buying a season pass, from buying the complete season bundle, and even for free in the UK or Australia. Is this locked to those regions, or can people in the US get it from any of those things?

Any help would be appreciated!
/////////////////////
For science people, why does Max need sugar to make a small bomb for the principal office' door? What does it do?
/////////////////////
Life is strange deals with a lot of with a lot of topics that are hard for people to deal with (suicide, bullying just to name a few) 

What controversial topic would you add to the game if you had the chance?
/////////////////////
A stickied support thread here for people who have just finished the game and are trying to piece their tattered emotions back together. Goddamn. 
/////////////////////
I already bought the game and now want to buy the Limited Edition for the Soundtrack and the Artbook. (Because this game is fucking awesome!)

Is there a Code inside that i can gift a Friend?(buying the PC version ofc) 
or how does it work?

Sorry for the stupid question but I just want to make sure it works.
/////////////////////
It's totally been a while since I last posted my FEELS on [Episode 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/46mv6p/just_finished_episode_1_no_spoilers_just_thoughts/) and [Episode 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/47x574/ep2_spoilers_just_finished_episode_2/) (life is busy haha) but I recently finished Chaos Theory and GOOD GRAVY WHAT A TWIST ENDING WHERE DO I EVEN BEGIN?

So in Episode 2, I saved Kate. It made me happy to see such support toward her. People were sending well wishes on her fb, on their room slates and even after digging in Victoria's room I learned even she felt guilty (GOOD) about her actions. I've sort of felt like the protective friend of Kate throughout the game so far so seeing everyone rally for her well being, I couldn't help but feel happy for her..

..Yet on the other hand. Some of it just felt like pure bullshit. Like y'all gonna support her now as if you always have been kind when pretty much all of you totally took part in sharing that video of her around or teasing her. Some of it was nice to see but other bits of it just came off as false sincerity like oh let's support her now because it's the right thing to do.

(picture me muttering under my breath here) even though most of y'all should've been there from the very beginning. 

I get sassy for Kate. 

Oh I TOTALLY forgot to water the plant. Which I'm super bummed about. I'm not sure where I failed in that but it happened. Even though I get the strong impression this game is not gonna have a cheery ending, I want the illusion of a "perfect playthrough". Even though I totally skipped on that date with Warren. But now the plant too.  

Most of this episode felt calm. Compared to the others at least. Like a calm before the storm you know? And I didn't mind it. 

Sneaking into the school with Chloe was cool. As was all the juicy tidbits on people. I appreciate so much that Max has an inner monologue for this game because it's great hearing her thoughts on things as much as me processing my own. 

Warren again came through for Max for making that bomb and again I regret turning the dude down for that drive in movie in the previous episode. 

The pool scene was so cool to me. Getting to see C and M just chat in that 2am deep talk kind of way was cool. A lot of this has been sort of watching them re-bond as friends. They're polar opposites to me and it's neat that despite that, they still stick with one another. 

A lot of it reminds me of real life, how you can stick with an old friend into adulthood. As we grow our friend(s) can change into someone completely different in the sense that if we were just meeting them now, and had no previous history, we might not even click as friends. And said friend might even get you in hot water. Some of us eventually reach a point where we drift away from said friend(s) but it's kind of cute to see that Chloe and Max (at least for now) are instead coming back around to one another.

Moving on, Chloe tried to kiss me and I was like NAH GIRL NAH. Although I did totally try both options which meant I first went with HEY GIRL HEY. I like the bond they have, but in a more platonic sense. Chloe is like fire and Max water and as silly as it might sound I feel like those two would clash as a couple. 

Which probably doesn't even matter CAUSE DAT ENDING but whenever these sorts of decisions come about, I try and look at the big picture. 

So I go downstairs, listen to that message about C's truck being seen at the school and I totes erased it. Seeing Joyce reminisce over breakfast was so cool to me like these sorts of lowkey moments I really value in the game because it makes it feel like a world lived in. 

But then C rolls in with her teen angst and snaps a bit. I felt bad for Joyce. 

And okay, as much as David is kind of off, I thought it was sweet he had the receipt in his car from when he first met Joyce. 

So I got through the password snoopy biz, then a fight happens shortly after he arrives and another decision. At first I side with David but only because Chloe lashes out irrationally so much to me rather than look at the big picture of things. Although I completely get where she's coming from in her misgivings. 

However, I wasn't too fond of how that scenario played out so I rewound and sided with C and got all up in D's grill like there was some sort of barbeque later. 

There wasn't, haha. 

Fast forward to the diner. This ep still feels calm, but it's also slowly picking up. 

Also, Max looks cute in flannel. Just saying. 

So I go inside, have my conversations with everyone. Learn a bit more about Nathan. It was interesting to learn his Dad is a dick to him. Which makes sense. The bully is bullied, who would have thought right? Still, I liked that touch. I liked learning a bit more about why he is who he is. 

Anyway, I get the keys, get in Frank's RV, reveal Rachel being snuggle buds with Frank. Chloe flies off the handle again (even though I understand) and on the ride to school Chloe seems like she's ready to push everyone away and mentions how it all went to crap once the situation with her Dad happened. 

LAWD I'VE BEEN WAITING TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 

So her looking into the picture happens and it shakes and I'm like yo was dat

but then it shakes more and I'm like YOOOOO. 

Easily the coolest part of the game so far. A twist within twists almost. I LOVED this so much. 

Like seriously you finally get to see her Dad and how great he was. He's like a ray of sunshine. Immediately I'm like okay it's GONNA LET ME SAVE HIM ISN'T IT WHY ELSE?

Turns out I was right but it almost had me for a bit. Like when it gets to the point when you have to hide his keys I kept failing. And that cutscene would play where Chloe says something about how Max is never leaving and as her Dad walks toward the white he says "that makes all of us". Or something of that nature. 

Which on it's own fucks you up because you know what happened..

..but I kept failing to hide the keys. And it was in this moment I wondered if the devs were throwing some kind of curveball within the twist. I slowly began to wonder if the whole point was me having to watch him leave each time, knowing that I couldn't save him no matter how hard I tried. 

Sound silly, but I AM IMMERSED. 

Eventually I did and Max was SO HAPPY and I WAS HAPPY but then then Twist 2: TWIST HARDER aka the butterfly effect happened. 

Max is popular? Within the Vortex Club? Warren has another lady? But Chloe's Dad is around YAY! But Chloe..

Ohhh that totes broke my heart. Seeing her roll up so upbeat and cheery but bound to the chair just made me so sad. And it made me think like, what was the better timeline? Like here they are both alive and seem happy so it makes more sense off the bat that this one is better in that sense but poor Chloe you know? That was just so sad and Max wears that emotion on her face. 

WHAT A FREAKING ENDING. Seriously had I had to wait for Episode 4 when these were slowly releasing one by one idk what I would have done. I mean, I haven't even started Episode 4 yet but that was just so heavy. 

I remember my jaw just dropped and even now I'm sitting here listening to the menu music of the game and it's just such a melancholy feeling. But now everything changes right? Like what about Rachel? 

And now there's the Vortex Club party coming up in Ep 4. Which I hear is one of the best episodes so I'm bracing myself. I'm SO eager to see what happens in this new timeline and if it ever goes back. 

Which I don't know if I want it too. I don't know what I want. I just want to keep playing and see where everything goes. 

Okay so I've rambled more than I planned and there's totally gonna be typos I'm sure but I DO NOT WANT THIS GAME TO END. But I wanna keep going. BUT THAT ENDING. BUT THIS GAME. 

cue me starting up episode 4

Seriously thanks for all the feedback from the past posts everyone. This is the best subreddit.  



/////////////////////
This has been bugging me the most when I think about the sequel.

On one hand, the emotional themes of the game are very tied into the idea of choice and consequence.  Obviously, you don't need time travel and time manipulation for that, but choice/consequence is like... *supercharged* because of this mechanic.  Being able to see the immediate consequences (but not the long term ones) of your actions gives everything so much more weight.  The writers were very good at making you feel like both choices were potentially the wrong ones, and the game let you revel in that and stress over it for a moment.  In that sense time travel/rewind is something that should probably stay.

On the other hand, the game's story was very much *driven* by the idea of time travel and manipulation.  You make choices and then you go back and consider others, and sometimes you go way back in time and completely rewrite history, and it becomes more and more desperate as you try to correct the seemingly endless complications.  Because of this, I find it difficult to believe they could use the same mechanic without either re-hashing the same plot with different characters/setting, or making the second game's story feel much more disconnected from the player experience and therefore more hollow.

I suppose time rewind could be kept without rehashing the plot while also having a genuinely cohesive experience.  But I'm just having trouble seeing it.  

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this?
/////////////////////
Of course, LiS is such a masterpiece, it's hard to find anything even close to it. But what other games (or media in general) comes closest to affecting you like LiS did?
/////////////////////
 I was wondering if you guys know of similar games out there that have similar themes or similar feel. I enjoyed the first 4 episodes of LiS but the fifth episode completely ruined the experience for me.

I've already played TWD (both seasons and 400 DLC) and Until Dawn. Heavy Rain, Indigo Prophesy and Beyond Two Souls don't appeal to me. I like regular, story heavy non 'cinematic' games as well, VNs and JRPGs.
/////////////////////
Hi, this is my first post on this subreddit and maybe my first post overall (this is an account I made a long time ago).

Anyway, this game hit me hard. Like, really hard. I was hooked from the start and everything- the characters, the story, the art and environment just immediately clicked. 

I started playing this game on Friday and played an episode every night until EP5 on Tuesday (last night), each taking me 3 hours or so. I'm an emotional guy and I must have cried at least 5 or 6 times during my whole experience (Most notably saving William and coming back to a world where Chloe is paralysed hit me the most, it really made me think about how important events in peoples lives are and the butterfly effect).

After that I really appreciated and understood that sometimes the bad things in our lives can lead to us discovering new paths and shape our entire personality (I absolutely adore Chloe's character, and her best moments with Max in my opinion are the biggest highs in the game)

But as I completed the final episode, which had a much more sombre atmosphere, I fell into an well of thought about how in such a short period of time these complex characters were dragging me into their world, I didn't want it to end, I wanted to go back to Blackwell and converse with the students, go on adventures with Chloe and even listen to Warren's cheesy lines.

The truth is- in real life I don't do much, I just wake up, go to university and come home to my computer. I'm 19, and being the same age as the characters made me realise how little I am actually living. This game, which I've only spent 15 hours of my life playing, has taught me so much; about myself and in general.

After the final decision where you choose to save either Chloe or Arcadia Bay, I chose to save Chloe, because although it was a selfish act, I genuinely have never had a friendship as close as her and Max's (some might call it more than a friendship). And I think one of the main reasons why this game has affected me so much is because I envy them. Despite the f**ked up things that happen, this game is truly beautiful in every way.

But I don't know what to do to get over it.

Thanks for taking the time to read, and I hope my post is written well enough for this sub. I'd love if anyone who feels the same or has anything different they experienced from playing this game to give me their thoughts.
/////////////////////
Welcome back ladies and gentleman.

If you could swap any character for the main role (keeping the story line the same) who would you want in place of max and why? 
/////////////////////
the pool scene and breaking into the school, when Max and Chloe wake up and lay in bed listening to music, they both wished Max didn't have to go to class, and I legitimately stayed there for at least ten minutes thinking that she could skip class and spend the day with Chloe. I wished she could've.

Rachel Amber seemed to be the most popular and interesting person in Arcadia Bay that we never formally met. People seemed to REALLY love and care about her, Chloe being highlighted from the rest. Who could blame her or anyone else? Rachel seemed like she could get along with every type of person and had her own dreams and aspirations. 

I wish we could have met her but it's good we didn't. A chunk of the game was us, the player, discovering who she was through other people, which thus helped us learn about the environment and the people around us. The mystery of her character is important to the story, largely.

She also seemed to be the type of person that Max would become through the progression of the story. Rachel was a confident, friendly person who was the world's muse. Max went from not leaving her room to saving Kate's life (if you made the right choices).

Regardless, the importance of Rachel Amber as a character goes WAY further than just "another character". She is what Max would become and what I believe the type of person many introverts, like myself, want to be.

I finished up Ep 5 yesterday (saved the town, regretted) and started reading some fanfiction and other such jazz. I find it weird that so many people thought there was a romantic thing going on between Max and Chloe, never once did I read their relationship like that. I didn't even see the kiss as romantic, I boiled that down to Chloe being her weird, daredevil-y self and Max deciding whether to be more carefree (yes, in my case). 

Did I miss some other cues in the game which hint at a romantic Pricefield thing or is this a case of fanfic going nuts?

Hi everyone, I was wandering through the PS store (Australia region) just then and found the LIS theme available for free! I believe it's the same one that was available to some of those that bought the season pass last year. I didn't buy the season pass though, just the physical limited edition when it came out. 

Also available for free is the LIS Sharefactory theme (I don't use Sharefactory so I can't comment on it). 

Normal theme:

that Elder Maxson is Mark Jefferson lol.

Also for anyone that doesn't know Chloe's voice actor plays one of the shopkeepers, too, but this is the first time I noticed Maxson's voice.

A couple days ago I posted on r/gaming asking for a happy game to play since I had just gone through a breakup. Long story short I bought South Park and this game, and I decided to play it first.

Not only did this accelerate my feels train, I've never been so moved by a fictional video game character. The bonding between you and the characters in this game just felt... surreal.

Thank you Dontnod and SE for publishing such a master piece. I will be looking forward for Season 2.

Emotion department nearly had a meltdown after the breakup and this game stacked on top of each other, but I think I'll be ok.
/////////////////////
I posted this over on the square enix forums but they don't seem to be very active... So I decided to copy and paste it over here to see what everyone else's thoughts are. I've seen a few other posts about it but I wanted to get my thoughts out there as well!

Just finished the game and going through the post game depression and withdrawals. Lets be honest. People who loved this game absolutely loved the characters in it. It is what made the story so great. Many people, including myself, wouldn't jump at the opportunity to play the sequel without the original characters. Chloe and Max are what make it so great (of course the other characters too) Without them it would hard to be as interested and call it a sequel.  And if they're around they should certainly remain the main characters.

I know people are saying that you can't or it's hard since there are multiple endings with major repercussions. It can be done. But the differences in the ending would have to be less impactful. It would be difficult to make a sequel with a story with chloe dead and the other story with her alive and the town gone. In order to remedy this one of the endings would have to be chosen to go with to continue the story of the second game. 

It could seem more seamless if maybe by letting chloe die doesn't save the town and a different action to be taken once going back. Once realizing sacrificing her was a waste you try and go back by some other means to stop her from dying. And once you save her you both escape the town when you realize you can't save it or convince its population to evacuate. Because lets be honest again... saving chloe was probably the more popular option so we'd just run with that one. I know people will be upset and say "your choices don't really matter" which is true in the end but the matter in the present time that they're happening and develop your characters and how you feel about them, so they still do matter regardless.

This would allow the story to continue by having Max's powers continue to plague and follow them as they're on the move and open a whole new window for different story lines. 

Anyways... I could sit here and type all day about possibilities. But this game was amazing and I loved Chloe and Max. It breaks my heart that such an amazing story is over. I hope that the developers can come up with a to keep them for the main characters because it definitely will not be the same without them nor drive many people back for the second game without them. I hope they listen to their fans ideas. 

/////////////////////
I told my cousin how amazing this game is.  She doesn't have an Xbox and lives on the other side of the world.  

Can someone point me to the best play through to watch without commentary that Max Pursues Chloe? 

I found one on youtube but I'm not sure they make the best choices or not, unless I watch it myself and I don't really have time.  But if no one has exactly what I'm looking for I'll just watch them myself first!

/////////////////////
Heard about this game from a watchmojo.com list about episodic video games. Looked at the game and was hooked. Now this game is now the most relatable piece of fiction I have ever seen.

My interpretation of Life is Strange, from the gunshot onwards, is just a dream. Max is a girl with ADHD because she is in an Individualized Education Program and procrastinates (like me, except I have no IEP). She was traumatized after seeing her old friend shot (my mom was shot in front of my eyes). She regressed to the fantasy of traveling back in time to what could have been (like when I was a kid, I wish I could have redone my actions). The story was all just imagined scenarios in her head to cope with problems (like me writing extraordinary stories). The tornado is a metaphor for the inescapability of reality and the dangers of escapism. In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, Max accepts reality as it is.

A tragic but realistic ending.

I'm gonna get a fretless bass in a few days and I want to get a custom, LiS-style, inlay on it around the part I've marked on [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/XtFCvK3.jpg) - but what sort of inlay? I've been thinking of either the rewind-spiral or a butterfly. It's going to be white anyway, other colors really don't fit well on the dark wood. Also, if you have other suggestions, keep them simple enough, as it's gonna be carved on the wood :D

Here's a strawpoll, too!
http://strawpoll.me/7219540
/////////////////////
If you could give yourself advice before you started your first playthrough what would it be? 


I would tell myself to slow down and enjoy the game. Sit at all the rest areas and take in the game for the art it is.


/////////////////////

/////////////////////
I'm referring to the "Save Arcadia Bay"/Chole dies ending.

**Kate**: Probably Max's closest female friend before the story started (she's the only Blackwell character besides Warren that Max had previously texted at the start of the story), so there would be no reason for that to change. Since they are both going through a tough time, it makes sense that they would support each other. Especially in Max's case, since she nearly lost Kate once, and lost Chloe permanently, she would want to be as good of a friend as possible.

**Warren**: Surely would do everything in his power to try to be there for Max (likely as seen by his presence at the funeral). In the end, they could date or just be good friends. But most likely, the only way they wouldn't be close is if Max tells him off, or if he ends up with Brooke and she stops him from spending so much time with Max. But it is hard for me to see him completely abandoning Max.

**Dana**: It definitely fits with her personality that Dana would try to be super nice to Max after Chloe died. She was at the funeral, so she would know that Max and Chloe were friends. Throughout the story, she plays a sort of "protector" role to Max (trying to get Max and Warren to go to the Halloween party with her and Trevor as double dates, saying they should have gone to the End of the World party together). Additionally, Max's self-commentary during the story implies that she genuinely likes Dana, Dana is sincerely happy when she sees Max at the EOTW party, and the relationship develops fairly organically. Dana switching to hanging out with the skater crew (Chloe's old friends) instead of the likes of Victoria/Logan, also makes Dana and Max spending time together much more likely. They might not be Kate/Max close, but I could see the two of them building a real connection.

There are other characters that Max could go out of her way to be better friends with (i.e. she mentions she should be better friends with Alyssa), but I feel like these are the most likely in the immediate aftermath of everything. Thoughts? Different ideas?
/////////////////////
Save everyone in town seemed to be a nobrainer to me. Would I want to kill all my classmates, teachers, everyone, on top of the dozens of dead birds and few dead whales? No, absolutely not. There is enough death already in this game. Still many here, about 50% according to the game statistics didn't want to sacrifice the life of one in order to save lives of dozens if not hundreds. I wish to be like you, I wish to be able to justify myself somehow the decision where I save Chloe - how can I change my mind?

**Edit 1** 

I haven't yet been able to get on the other side. I can't see myself teaming up with Chloe. I can't accept that dozens of residents die. I don't feel sympathy for them but on the other hand I don't want the innocent to die from something I've done. I see this theme repeating in other threads: "Not many people died." and "You can't be sure that the storm was caused when Max was using those powers." To me both of these sound like denial. 

Chloe went with full force on Nathan, being aggressive and accusing him. How this was working later in the game - ended up killing Frank and Pompidou. That kind of character is Chloe. So attacking verbally the weakling Nathan just lead to what would've occurred when you deal with aggressive and mentally unstable person with a weapon - they will react.

I don't know how Max could live after such grim decision of being responsible of so many deaths after saving Chloe. Somehow I feel immune to the pain of Chloe. Max left Chloe, she didn't stay in touch with her, she moved on, Chloe was able to find a new friend after Max left. Some strange consequences drove these two together and all the events strengthened their bond. So if that can happen so easy with Chloe, then why it would not happen with any other person. Chloe and Max spent their childhood together and have a lots of memories but when they grew older, their ways separated. I wasn't able to see them being equal to each other. That's all for now. 

I love what this game has done to me. I love how it sticks in your mind and makes you ask questions. 

**Edit 2** 

I went to see the other ending. The town is destroyed and they just drive away?! Are you fucking kidding me. I see no effort to search for survivors, I see no effort to do anything. I don't see Chloe mourn for Joyce. Nothing. I feel now stronger that this is the end I didn't want to have. I didn't want to stay in the fantasy world. I wanted to wake up, face the shit that is being thrown at my face, but keep on going anyway. 
/////////////////////
I recently played Life Is Strange and, as one might expect, completely fell in love with it and its characters (Chloe ... ;_; -- oh wait, none of those), then spent most of my free time on the Easter weekend watching Let's Plays.

After learning of the PC limited edition, I ordered it yesterday and am now wondering ... the actual game there is still the regular Steam version, isn't it? And the other extras (soundtrack, artbook) in the box itself? 

So my main question there is ... if I wanted to gift this game to someone, what is the ideal approach? I don't really want to just keep the second license I just acquired for myself, not with a game so emotionally touching that I feel others should experience. Can I register the code on Steam and gift it through their system (if doable, probably the best option with no licensing grayzones involved)? Does that work? 

If not, I suppose I could basically gift that person the code so that they can register it as their game. The hard-copy game CD, if there even is one, is presumably just the install files you can't do anything with if you don't register on Steam and thus doesn't really matter, right?

Thank you for your assistance.
/////////////////////
Tears were had and my buddy and I medicated to dull the pain
/////////////////////
What was your choice at the last decision and why?
I chose the "Save Chloe" ending. I did this after thinking over it for nearly half an hour. After that time, I came back to my computer and was slowly moving my mouse towards "Sacrifice Chloe" until I made a fatal mistake.

I pressed tab.

The journal opened up, to my surprise, and I noticed that there were more pages than there had been the last time I checked. Desperately wanting a distraction from the horrible choice I had to make, I read the final few pages of Max's journal.

"Chloe is more to me than my best friend"

"I don't regret [kissing Chloe] for a second"

"Chloe being so cruel in the nightmare"..."flirting with all those people"..."it was like a physical pain in my heart"

"Is that the power of friendship...or love?"

"Shit," I croaked, holding back the tears in my eyes. I knew what I had to do. I knew why I had to do it. I knew the consequences of my actions. "Shit," I said again, pressing escape and sliding my mouse to the right.
/////////////////////
I really do want to go back but I don't know if I'm ready to go through it all again.  Is it easier the second time? 
/////////////////////
I just came here to say, I [swearword] lovvveee this game. This is what's right with gaming. Well at least to me. See I'm not even a gamer right, it takes a lot of great stuff to sit me down, and have me hooked for hours upon hours. Like really, I cannot sit down and shoot people all day. Or control a car. Or going through one type of level design all the [swearword] time! And this is why Life is so [swearword] Strange!

 There is so much to love about this game alright? It is completely new, I haven't played anything like it. And frankly I should have a problem with its limiting style of gameplay. I can only do things that relate to my current mission [I would like to use my [swearword] computer whenever I like!], and also the fact that I can't just go wherever I want at any time. These things bug me a little. But then again they don’t! Because there is so much to be distracted by. The art, the music, the story, the personality and [swearword] effort that went into creating this movie/game/drug whichever, it is all fighting for your love.

If this is some mind-influence shit, you [swearword] got me. Beautiful game man, and I never [swearword] regret getting it.

/////////////////////
In the song Lua, one of the lines goes

&gt; But me I'm not a gamble, you can count on me to split.

I was wondering to myself, split? What is that supposed to mean?

And then I remembered of the British show ["Golden Balls"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Balls), where you split or steal in a prisoner's dilemma sort of situation. When both players split, they split the prize money. If one splits and one steals, the stealer gets all the money. If both players steal, no one gets money.

In this situation, he's just saying he'd always split the money with his opponent/friend. In other words, putting them first.
/////////////////////
I mean we know Victoria was practically throwing herself at him, and hated Max because she was the center of his attention.

And Max said the only reason she came to Blackwell was Jefferson. So could it be possible she had a crush on him?
/////////////////////
If you could add a character to the life is strange game who would you add and what role would they play? (Can be a pre existing character or whole new one)
/////////////////////
I just finished Life is Strange and I've been thinking about an better alternative ending, whether it is consistent an ending where Chloe does not die and the poblation from Arcadia Bay does not die by the tornado.

I see an ending where Chloe does not die and the tornado does not occur is impossible, but Max and Chloe can persuade Nathan for that his father decides to call the authorities and evacuate the population from Arcadia Bay. Max has information for persuade Nathan and Prescott family has enough power to evacuate Arcadia Bay. Opinions?

/////////////////////
A few months back, I ended up buying the SquareEnix bundle for whichever game I don’t even remember now. But this last week I saw LiS in my games list and decided to pick it up and give it a try. I knew absolutely nothing about the game, and thought it would be another crappy “episodic story game”. I would never have expected a life changing experience to come like this. It was so relatable and emotional, that it has changed my view on life as is.

This last month has been very hard on me. I, a senior in highschool, (One reason I think this is so relatable) had a massive falling out with everyone I ever knew and loved. The only person I thought I could truly trust, had abandoned me, and I thought that was it. I had nobody to lean on or go to, and had lost all hope. Suicide was one option, drugs and alcohol another, but instead, I’m here. With this game, and this community. 

My experience playing this game, has been like no other. It encaptured me and my broken self. All of my subdued emotions, as throwing them aside was the only way I knew how to deal with them, could finally break free. After close to a year and a half of dry eyes, this game finally made me shed tears. I felt so attached to everyone in the game. It all felt so sincere and real, and all I’ve wanted to do is experience it again. Every theme touched on in the game has been something I myself have had to go through, and it helped me understand how everything can, and will happen. You may not want it to, but it has. Letting go may not be possible at the time, but it’s something that needs to happen, and will happen as time passes.

Yesterday, something compelled me to purchase a copy of this for that person who abandoned me. We alone have been through much together. Depression, self-harm, suicide. Most everything. I knew this was an experience they needed to have, so even after a month of the cold shoulder, I sent a copy, thinking, no matter what, this choice would have consequences. 

Today, I received a message from them, simply thanking me, but that alone was enough for us to have a conversation after a month of silence. I feel as if this game will be the catalyst for redemption and forgiveness. Sometimes Life is Strange
/////////////////////
Hi everyone. I'm in the process of doing a writeup on the game, and I'd like to include some links to relevant fan/critic/official websites, as there's a lot of cool/interesting stuff about the game out there. Alas, most of said cool/interesting stuff is scattered across Reddit, Tumblr and Youtube. That's not ideal, but I can whittle down to the coolest and interestingest (it's a word! shut up!) of stuff. I'd much prefer *general hubs* to specific essays or art.      

What I'd like to include are some of the more "serious" criticism and writing sparked by the game, as well as a hub for fan-made original content. [Life is Strange Fans](http://lifeisstrangefans.com/) covers the latter, but the former's entirely case by case. Which is a shame, because this is probably far and away the most thoughtful and mature game fan community at the moment, and I've seen a lot of really insightful writing that cuts deeper than the (important, necessary institution of) Max/Chloe shipping. I want to point at that with a very serious big foam finger. Is there any central area where that stuff gravitates?       

Overall, I was wondering what you all thought were some good LiS related sites or projects in case there's anything really great out there that I've missed in my cursory stumblings. I'm already familiar with Koethe and the Blackwell Podcast (and I think both are really wonderful). I'm mostly asking out of personal curiosity here, too; I'd like to see more LiS content, especially if it's thoughtful, beautiful, kind or creative.   

Thanks, everyone. Be well!

Hello, everyone!

I'm conducting a research on how *Life is Strange* addresses violence related issues ─cyber-bullying, domestic violence, sexual abuse and so on- and how the game community responds to the game. I'd be glad to hear your responses, thanks in advance.

What do you think about the following issues:

* As I was browsing certain posts on Reddit, I have realized that it was not just me, *Life is Strange* really did change many people's minds. How effective do you think that *Life is Strange* on raising social awareness about those violence related issues?

* What do you think about SquareEnix's social awareness campaign #EverydayHeroes? Is it just a marketing strategy, or is it another dimension of immersing the player into the game's universe (with the same contest name "Everyday Heroes")?

**Spoiler alert**

* "[EP2 SPOILERS](#s "Were you able to save Kate?")" If not, how this event in the play affected your overall gameplay experience?

Hello again ladies and gentlemen.


If you could bring any mechanic from any game to life is strange, what would it be?

As promised, updating everyone on the release of the final chapter of my fic, A Dancing Prism.  
  
The story takes place in late April - the last few days before Rachel Amber's disappearance. It's filled with dangerous and colorful events that she indulged in and all the mysteries and complicated relationships she kept up. I've tried my best to keep the level of depth close to the game - you will find multiple lines of symbolism as well as many details and references to the game and the outside world. The story is **not** an AU - all depicted events are based on evidence and dialogue from the game, so the entire thing can technically be called a big theory.  
  
**You can read it on:**

I've made this video to tribute the game but I think that it could be better.
Any suggestion?

/////////////////////
So, yeah, title. 

Obviously I've checked Amazon but they all look a little to thick. Like actual flags. I was hoping to find one that is a bit sheer so I can hang it up like Chloe's and still let some light filter in. I'm not entirely sure what I should be searching. 
/////////////////////
As someone who is a crier, I am surprised at my lack of emotional response to this game. I cry at everything: babies being born, people hearing for the first time and don't even get me started on soldier coming home videos.... 

But I didn't cry. The only moment in which I was close was when we find Rachel's body and Chloe is hysterical. I just felt so bad for her in that moment. Other than that, I really wasn't that moved. Maybe it was my high expectations from the reviews I read before it or the fact that there was way too much talking/stuff to look at (I am the type that HAS to look at everything and talk to everyone) that left me feeling frustrated waiting for the plot to continue. 

I probably would have cried if I choose the Bay over Chloe and had to watch her die. But other than that, I wasn't that moved.
I was nice to everyone, I was able to save Kate (probably would have cried if I didn't), I became friends with everyone so maybe that added to it. I was never wondering if I made the right choices or not because everyone lived. 

Anyways, should I play it again? Should I do something different to see if it impacts me more?
/////////////////////
First of all, I found out about LiS by accident, I guess. The often-mentioned TIFU post and a few other random Reddit posts and comments praising it. I got it, left it gathering a bit of dust, and finished it three days ago. Holy shit what a rollercoaster it was. I absolutely loved it, from start to finish, etc. etc.  
The point of this post is that I'm still feeling guilty of my final decision: I chose to save Arcadia and let Chloe die. I absolutely loved Chloe, I never would've guessed how important she'd be when she picked up Max after her face-off with Nathan in the parking lot. As I continued my love for her grew to a strange fascination for her. How could two people, at first glance, so different from each other, end up becoming the best of friends?  I can't remember any other fictional character, be it from a TV show, movie, or game, who captivated me this much. Long story short, I really liked Chloe.  
Initially, I would've done anything for her well-being, just like Max. However, her final speech as Max and her are in the middle of the storm next to the lighthouse, telling Max that she can't let her mother, who sacrificed so much for her, die because of something she caused, made me choose to save Arcadia. At first I didn't want to, Chloe was the most special person in Max's life and I'd made my decisions in order to appease Chloe. But the emotion with which she said made me think that she'd feel very guilty if she lived and everyone they knew in Arcadia, including Chloe's fucking family, died instead. Needless to say, when Nathan pulled the trigger in the bathroom, I cried more than Max did. A shitload more.  
I feel stupid having these feelings because of a game. It's a beautiful work of art all-around, but in the end it's just a game. I never thought that three days after finishing it I'd randomly tell myself "you killed Chloe Price, you fucking asshole".  
What I want to know is, did you feel remorse because of your final decision or was it more straight-forward? Is it normal to feel this bad because of such a decision?
/////////////////////
Makes me start the day with a nice feeling.
/////////////////////
In the beans thread it came up that even with the rewind ability, spilling the beans seemed "too far" (paraphrasing).

I can think of a few choices that I haven't tested in two plays, and that I'm not sure I ever will:

* Taking Kate's call in the diner - I always answer, no matter how much I hate Chloe being angry at me.

* Accepting alternate Chloe's request - I don't have the words for why; but I just can't refuse.

* Letting Chloe killing Frank be the end of that scene - How could I pile that on top of all her other problems?

 
Do you have an roads you just can't take - even with the ability to rewind them?

Hello dear sub!
I finished the last episode of LiS a couple of hours ago and I was browsing this subreddit, when I noticed something weird.
Everyone feels like this adventure changed their life in some way, positively or negatively, everything reminds them of the game in real life and the feels are just overwhelming.
I've always thought I'm a sensitive guy (even though I have never cried for a movie/book/videogame), but during the gameplay nothing special connected me with Life is Strange.
I mean yeah, I enjoyed the game a lot and loved Max and Chloe, the plot twists at the end of parts 3 and 4 surprised me and the final catched me, but that was weaker than expected, and I feel still further from the characters than the average player.
Am I heartless or sick?
/////////////////////
but you'll have to pay a Price.
/////////////////////
I found out about LiS through a TIFU, where OP had described his friend drinking himself into the hospital after playing post-breakup. I made a mental note in my head that if I ever had time, I wanted to play this infamous "feel bad" game that was attributed to fucking so many people up. 

After episode three, I made an interested note at the fact that there was even a crisis helpline/support group in game for people affected. 

I personally have to admit that even though I had planned on playing this game for the purpose of being fucked up, I had a very strong and willful bravado, if you will. I definitely put on my tough guy suit in a vow to counter the odds and not let myself get fucked up by said game. 

That being said, I just finished episode five, and my tough guy makeup has washed away with my tears. 

There's a lot to be said about this game. Although many people don't like cause/effect storylines because there isn't a lot of "action" to them (namely, the aspect of getting to beat people up), this didn't feel like your average cause/effect game. It was really easy to become immersed into the world, and although I was cocky about it going in, I found myself getting sucked into the lives of Arcadia Bay. I made notes to the similarities from "The Butterfly Effect," which honestly put me off slightly, but the lives and the detail to the game made it extremely difficult not to get lost in. 

Throughout the game, I found myself trying to help and save everyone that I could. Yes, I am that sort of gamer. I am the gamer who feels remorse for kicking chickens in Fable, I am the gamer who cannot hurt the virtual feelings of NPC's. I'm a big softy, sue me. 

Anyway. That drive to save is really what fucked me up in the end. I'd become so attached to the main objective that the end really messed with my head. It was sort of an existential thing. 

Having a head already messed up with mental illness, granted, it was definitely a big decision allowing myself to play this game under the guise that I was going to be the odd duck that was unaffected. 

The lesson I've taken away is depressing as hell, sure, but it's very enlightening. It's not something that anyone really wants to acknowledge, the fact that we can't always spare the feelings of the people around us. We can't always be in control of the situations that occur, and instead we're simply at the mercy of our environment. However, likewise, it's comforting to think about the repercussions of our actions. Although they may be small, they contribute to a picture that is much larger than ourselves. 

I really (fuck) really wanted to save everyone. I wanted to spare everyone, and end up with the happy ending, were justice was served and nobody was hurt. Instead, LiS gives you the bitter ending, seasoned with reality and sauteed in fucking your emotions up. It was really powerful to me to see the final global comparisons. 47% versus 53% in the final decision. That's absolutely incredible to me. 

Life is fucked up, life is unhappy, life is a reality. Life is awe inspiring, life is happy, life is a possibility of realities. 

Life is fucking strange. 

9.8/10, just because I wanted to punch Nathan Prescott in the nose every time he opened his mouth. 
/////////////////////
I have no evidence against David or Nathan. The only person I can name is Mark since the options the game gives at that point are true to the circumstances. I was surprised to see that he was least likely accused person (13% for him, 14% for David and the rest for Nathan). Why is that, and did I miss something? I don't have any evidence against Nathan who seems to be the main suspect who has caused Kate to lose all hope.
/////////////////////
Does that mean that if you sacrifice Chloe, Max can read her diary and know everything that happened if she saved Chloe?
/////////////////////
As a few others, I decided to get a tattoo to commemorate my all time favourite game. My original idea was to get Chloe's sleeve but as I kept thinking, I have hundreds of other ideas I want to fit on to my arm, all with little to no skin between them and unfortunately, Chloe's had too much skin and would cover another of my already existing tattoos. 

So a few weeks ago I went to my usual artist and got something simpler, but equally as beautiful: the Morpho Butterfly.

It was easy to install and use. It's super awesome, and I really like how the left side buttons work.

/////////////////////
Had a dream that I had Max's rewind powers. I was at work, and then my friend got hired there, and because she got hired, she also got rewind powers, and if she was rewinding and I was looking at her, I wouldn't be affected, but if I turned my head away, everything looked rewindy, and she said my head looked rewindy when I turned it and she got a picture of it. Then I was going to test the theory of "If I'm holding on to a person, will they also rewind," but then her ex-boyfriend showed up and also got a job and rewind powers. So I didn't get to try it, and we were digging underneath the shed at my work trying to find something a kid said they had buried there. My fiance also worked there, but he didn't have rewind powers, nor did he know about rewind powers. 

It seems like my subconscious is taking different aspects of the game (time rewind, digging for Rachel's body), and making them related to my real life work. 
/////////////////////
Did anyone else feel like... if you tell David the truth about Chloe, that he kills himself? I just had this horrible feeling that the game was hinting that he shot himself. In my playthrough, I got kicked out, and told the truth. After I left the dark room,  I felt this... eerie presence.
/////////////////////
This is a little poem I did when I was bored. It's about Max who is 'talking' to Chloe after sacrificing her.

Life Is Strange,  
Isn't it, my friend?  
I traveled through time,  
Only to see you die again.  
  
All of our moments  
Before you were dead,  
Are forever lost in time;  
Remembered only in my head.  
  
Our hang out, our kiss,  
Our discovery of a crime,  
Is now buried, like Rachel,  
And forgotten with time.  
  
But you did save Arcadia,  
And put Nathan in custody.  
You're also with Rachel, now.  
You're with good company.  
  
Life Is Strange,  
It holds pain and misery,  
But that's my fault, I should've known...  
*Nothing can change destiny.*
/////////////////////
Let me start by introducing myself.  I'm Megan, and I'm 16 years old;  I played LiS for the first time in February.  

This game has been deeply meaningful to me, as I know it is to all of you.  And, well, like a lot of you- I caught mad feelings for a blue-haired beanie wearing punk (who just also happens to be a fictional video game character).   That being said,  my first playthrough-  I saved Chloe without a second thought.  I didn't want a character I had come to love so much to die-  she never deserved to die.  She is a survivor,  how is any of it fair?

Despite my punk boo surviving at the end of my first playthrough, afterwards I still felt empty.  The post-LiS depression still hit me like a brick.  Let's get personal-  I have never been the type to have friends.  I want to.  I want to live out this crazy time in my life the way Chloe and Max do- I want to live and be surrounded by people I love or to have someone like Chloe or Warren-  someone who accepts me with and for my flaws and who I do right back.  

I kept Chloe alive because I wanted to have my own Chloe.  

*IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ THIS WHOLE THING START HERE*
On my second playthrough, I started out believing I was going to once again Sacrifice Arcadia Bay at the end- I couldn't let go of Chloe.  But talking to all the characters- Kate, Warren, Joyce, Frank, hell, even Samuel, I was starting to realize how wrong it felt to let them die.  Warren saved Max's bony white ass on multiple occasions, Max saved Kate's life, Joyce made Max breakfast, Frank rescued Pompidou, and Samuel talked with Max about squirrels.

I had to fight the urge to save Chloe at the very end.  I couldn't let all of these other people in Arcadia Bay die.  It really was an internal conflict.  As much as I wanted happiness for Chloe and Max, I realized it was impossible for them to find it together.  Chloe is already so broken.  She's lost so much.  If she lost Joyce?  Yeah, maybe Max and Chloe can drive away together after letting everyone in Arcadia die, and fuq that shit, ELOPE, and live happily ever after and Max can hold Chloe when she has PTSD, or nightmares of finding Rachel's body, not to mention Joyce's.. 

But Life is Strange is about growing up.  When I, with tears already soaking my pale, computer lit face, forced myself to choose to sacrifice Chloe- then got to kiss her (I've got game). I watched Chloe get shot, I went to her funeral... That was that.  I felt an extreme sense of relief, I felt no guilt, because I didn't kill people who weren't destined to die, and who cared about Max so much.  I grew up.  And I cried hard; yeah- but I didn't fall into the depression like I did after my first playthrough;  I stood up, looked at my ugly-ass splotchy cry face in the mirror- and smiled.  I am so glad I replayed the game, I feel it has impacted me more and in a better way the second time. 

TL;DR:  was a hardcore bae&gt;bay believer,  was depressed after ending despite Chloe living.   Playing through a second time, felt hardcore guilt thinking about deaths of other characters.  Chose bay&gt;bae this time.  Realized that LiS is about growing up, which is what I had to do to sacrifice Chloe.  Felt instant relief and was amazed at how much better the "sacrifice Chloe" ending made me feel.


Disclaimer: I don't discredit you if you chose Chloe and still stand by that till the day you die!  LiS means something different to everyone &lt;3

P.S. IF YOU ACTUALLY READ THE ENTIRE THING I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU- COME ON OVER TO MY HOUSE FOR BEANS AND TO MAKE SELF-DEPRICATING JOKES!

###Still haven't beaten ep 4 or 5 so please no spoilers!

Many months ago I accidentally deleted my life is strange save, all the way up to episode 4 (like halfway through it).

I was pretty bummed since I don't want to replay the entire story over again to get all my choices the same, so I waited about 4 months before I retried the game to get back into it. I'm bored af since I know everything that's going to happen and to top it off the game is glitching where some of the characters are invisible preventing progress (ep 2, right after trying to enter Mr. Jefferson's class it's just floating cameras taking pictures of air)
_______
So now I'm thinking about doing the randomized options.

**main questions**

* do my choices in episodes 1 - 2 affect episode 3,4, or 5 at all?

* is there some editable file where I can pick my choices outside of playing the game?[](/flutterstare)

Hello and welcome back once more, ladies and gentlemen, to the Daily Topic thread. Unfortunately, I must announce that this is the last thread from me. Many real life matters have been pressing for a while, plus, to put it frankly, I'm running out of ideas for these threads. I'm just very happy that we got to this beautiful number of 100.

A huge thanks to everyone who participated in these threads, filling them with their thoughts, ideas and experiences. I'm very glad that I got to read them all, even if I haven't responded to each and every one of them. *Sorry*

If anyone wants to continue Daily Topic threads, they're free to do so. I only want to wish the best of luck to you all and leave you with the last question from me:

Which Daily Topic was your favourite? Which LiS moment was your absolute favorite? If you could rewind in real life, how often would you use it and for what purposes?
/////////////////////
So a good friend of mine looks like/ reminds me sooo much of Chloe and today she took a picture of herself in a bathroom and I was like please don't do this to me lmao
/////////////////////
Literally, not spill Frank's beans back in Episode 3.

While I was walking around the maze in the nightmare section, Frank yelled at me for spilling his beans, even though I made a point not to do that (I was too scared to see his reaction).

The game obviously *assumed* that I did, which, to be fair, is understandable in a game based on redoing stuff. But it made me wonder if anyone else let him eat his beans in peace.
/////////////////////
This post will be different than majority of posts here. Life is Strange was my light in the darkness during past months, the first game I've ever purchased, something which I was completely obsessed about.
But now after second playthrough (and choosing not very popular ending here) I think it's over. I didn't play for almost a month and I'm totally totally sad about it because having a post LiS depression was actually a beautiful feeling just as this game is such a great experience. I would give everything to be able to suffer, to feel and to enjoy what you enjoy people but it's just... gone. I cannot even listening to the soundtrack because it makes me feel guilty about not caring anymore.
Maybe it's my decision to postpone further playing until I buy a new laptop on which this game will look like much better and smooth not like my current lag fest. Maybe there are other factors I don't know. But I know one thing, I'm incredibly sad that after those amazing months of playing something ended for me and I'm very sorry... Reality ensued, I have many things on my mind right now, I can't focus on the game and I won't buy a new laptop until the end of this year. Maybe you have some advices how to cope with post-post LiS depression and how to feel again. Because I feel like after broken up relationship.

The time when Chloe said this was 2008.. were computers really that rare back then in Oregon? Because she seemed to empathize that it was really uncommon for people to have a computer at home.

After I finished playing LiS I felt empty inside, or even a bit depressed. But I never could put it quite to words until I read this review: https://killscreen.com/articles/the-triumph-of-despair-in-life-is-strange .
"Chloe in the wheelchair, next to her dad, is a lesson in that perverse precept: despite your best efforts, or often for no reason at all, reality itself is your punisher. That idea of things just happening, and being able to feel in the face of that idea, only despair, is a far-reaching human experience, one that Life Is Strange grotesquely—almost gleefully—illustrates."

That's when it clicked. I've always identified with max, as someone who always is himself regardless of the social consequences, and also as someone who 'lives in the past'. This is also due to my almost eidetic memory. I can remember the past in vivid detail, including how I felt (and in a way looking at past events in my mind I almost always feel exactly the same as I did back then.) But another thing that max and I have in common is that we always try to help people. In my case I expect something in return for it. Or atleast, that's hard to admit for me, I expect something in life from it. I always thought that no matter how bleak my life currently seems, if I kept moving forward with the right intentions, being myself and helping others, karma would find me and reality would change to make my life better. That's what in the end made me get through each day, no matter how horrible things seemed.
But, as LiS clearly illustrated; Karma doesn't exist and despite my best efforts, if reality has decided that I should suffer for some reason there is no way for me to prevent it, no matter the amount of good I do to others and no matter the amount of hope I have that life will improve.
That leaves me with a terrible emptiness with which I've been living for the last 5 months after I finished playing LiS.
Now, I need to find another 'default mindset mode' to live my life with. And I don't know which that should be. But I guess I'll need professional help for that, which I'm getting asap.
/////////////////////
Sometimes I like to lurk on r/glitch_in_the_matrix and it mentioned another subreddit called dimensional jumping. I'm not going to say whether or not I believe in these things, because I don't actually know, and it really doesn't matter. 
Anyway, I followed the link to the dimensional jumping subreddit out of curiosity. I was reading their "how to jump dimensions" and how you can think of a dimension or version of yourself you want to jump into. 
In these other dimensions, there are small changes. But if I've learned anything from this game, one small change can have big consequences. Max saved William, (although I guess that isn't a small change), and Chloe was in a wheelchair. Max saves Chloe in episode 1, there's a tornado that destroys the town. I feel like if I hadn't played this game and I were browsing that subreddit, these thoughts would not have crossed my mind. As a result of playing this game, the theory of dimensional jumping is not something I want to test, because should it turn out to be real, I don't want to potentially screw myself.
/////////////////////
Just finished this amazing game and it was truly a roller-coaster ride.

I know that there are many lessons to take away from this game about like, but to me I think the thing that kept hitting me in the face throughout the game is....

Never judge a person by the cover....Everyone has a redeeming quality to them. Its incredible how this game achieves this.... Not one character in this game was perfect or inherently bad... they were all flawed.

Lets start with Max- A quiet and shy student who keeps to herself however given the chance she was able to crack through that and evolve into the amazing person that we all witnessed. Yet she was no hero; far from it. Everything she did it was because she thought she was helping but nothing ever panned out like she thought it would. Not even having a superpower could save her from being helpless at times

David Madsen- A character that I disliked from the very start only to realize how fleshed out he was at the end. At his core he was and is a soldier, and everything he did was for the love he bore Chloe and Joyce, but he just went about it through the way he had become accustomed to.

Frank- At first a stereotypical junkie drug dealer that put fourth an image of violence. While he liked to wave his knife around, I genuinely believed that he did not intend to hurt anybody (which Chloe likes to occasionally say). This is again highlighted when you tell him about Rachel and how his drug dealing had a part in her death, you can really see the remorse in his face.

Principle Wells- My first impression was that he was in with the Prescott's but really his job just put him in crossfire between Arcadia bay and the Prescott's. He was doing what was best for the school even if it meant turning a blind eye to certain events.

Chloe- A great example of how tragic experiences shapes an individual. A once full of hope and aspiring individual turned rebellious and cynical but even through this her core values were still the same (which can be seen by comparing her alternate reality and her current reality as well as comparing her essence wilst max which still remained the same even after the accident)

Heck even Nathan- A troubled teen who was in need of dire help but was given the cold shoulder by his parents only to be used by a psychotic photographer... its hard not to feel sorry for him
This was a truly amazing game
/////////////////////
I frequently see people say things like, "We have no reason to believe that the townspeople died" or, "I didn't see any bodies in the streets" or similar things basically saying that there's a chance/likelihood that their favorite Bay citizens not named Max and Chloe still somehow survived even if they picked the bae ending. The way I see it, either Chloe dies, or literally everyone else in Arcadia Bay dies. Max frequently says as a statement of fact that, "Everyone will die." Also, if  the townspeople survived, it would really undercut the gravity of the choice, because why wouldn't you pick bae if the Bay citizens will live either way? Also, Max and Chloe wouldn't immediately leave. They'd stay in town, look for any and all survivors, and try to provide what little assistance they can, since they'd be compelled by a sense of guilt. By leaving as soon as they can, it implies that there is literally nothing left for them in Arcadia Bay. Nothing. At least, that's how I interpret it, and that's what I think the writers were trying to go for. Does anyone agree that arguing that some townsfolk may have survived the bae ending is contrary to what the game was trying to go for?
/////////////////////
So earlier today someone made a post asking the question: "but surely I can't be the only one that killed Chloe for the sake of the Bay?".  
  
 Here's the full post: https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4blanh/ep5_spoilers_doesnt_anyone_else_love_the_bay_more/  
 
  (First of all let me say, I chose to save the bay. It's literally the only choice that made sense to me. I loved Chloe way more than any other character, but realistically I'm not going to condemn hundreds of people that I also know and love to death for the sake of one girl. It's utterly ridiculous.)  
  
But this is all besides the point. The point is, the OP posed a reasonable question, opened up a reasonable discussion, and everyone gave their own reasonable answers. A lot of people agreed with OP that they saved the bay over Chloe. And you know what happened? *People fucking down voted them*. For answering a question.  
  
To whom it concerns, you don't down vote someone for posing an innocent opinion that you just happen to disagree with. It's immature and straight up discouraging people from participating in conversation. There's a chance I might be making a bigger deal about this than necessary, but it really rubbed me the wrong way.  
Grow up people. You know who you are.
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back to daily discussions! Today, we're gonna discuss about:

Could you predict how your life would've went if you never played LiS? Share!
/////////////////////
There are none of them! Maybe is this the thing that makes the game so sad?

I've made my thoughts:

- I'm a man, Italian. Here usually girls are always joyful. Maybe in America girls are different? Less likely to laugh? Maybe is it just Max?! I have to say, I FUCKING LOVE HER; quiet when she needs to, talks when she has to. And yeah yeah its product of development so she had to be perfect somehow.

Cried when she did, angry when she was, scared of her bad dreams too.

But laughing? Hardly. I think a Max that would have made me laugh surely would have made me more attached to her and pumped the feels train a lot. But she's not that type, I'm ok with it (I still seriously love the way she looks tho, very very cute and enchanting)

- SURELY the story was written to be the strongest sad punch to the brain now and then. 

Things happen fastly, destroy Max so she has to focus totally on stuff that is weird for her.

Time travel? I personally would be so scared of that power the fucking butterfly flapping chaos theory thing would transform into a hurricane.

She learns how to use this power, calms down, changes the path of reality and keeps commenting what is around her. Fits perfectly.

But still needing a funnier Max, or OTHER characters maybe... (Just think about Undertale)

- LAST BUT NOT LEAST. The integration of all the secondary characters is weak, even for some key ones.

Would have liked to know more about Jefferson, Nathan, Victoria, WARREN.

You know so little about them that is ALMOST impossible to get hints at the start of the game about how it would have ended. Pretty clever decision.

But.

This three main things sums up my final thought:

The game goes on fastly and you stick with Max perception, we almost all fit with her thoughts, some yes some no, but she is the one who speaks so you have to stay there and read all the fucking thoughts that go in her head and accept them. Boring sometimes, I have to say, perfect in other times.

As you go on you get attached a lot to the characters: Max, Chloe, Joyce, David, Rachel, etc.

But because of their stories.
Think about it, they had to be somehow sad. I instead would have liked to see more happy stories just to compensate and make me LESS aware of the ending and yeah, hit me with that 20t feels train, crack my heart, fill my head with sadness for days, make me wanna song guitars or draw or trip or know some hippy people and smoke weed with them...

Just some thoughts, my head is crazy after ending the game. Would appreciate your point of view.

More or no more happy happenings?

(If you still dont understand, I'm italian, bad english so sorry for it. Anyway for happy happenings I mean more funny moments, happy thoughts, nice facts...)
/////////////////////
I just beat the game a couple days ago, and wow it totally took me by surprise. I chose to sacrifice Chloe in the end, and overall I liked the ending except for one thing.

Couldn't Max have tried to stop the bleeding or something after Chloe got shot? If she didn't have any time powers and this were the original timeline, wouldn't Max have ended up trying to save her from bleeding out instead of standing by? A shot to the gut shouldn't = certain death. And since that's all she really changed from the get-go, everything after Chloe gets shot should be fair game. It shouldn't cause the storm to appear. One of the deciding factors in me choosing that option was that I figured max would still have time to save her after the initial shot took place, but she didn't even try. 

That said, this is one of the best games I've ever played, and listening to the soundtrack has been there only way to fill the void of my soul these past couple days
/////////////////////
Hi there, sorry if this isn't the right place for this. I'm completely stuck at the point where Max has to hide from the security guard at the swimming pool. I've heard to hide behind the middle lockers or in the furthest stall in the bathroom. But the game is completely pitch black at this point (at least on my crappy monitor) and I literally cannot see to get around. I try to awkwardly position myself in the dark but keep getting caught. Does anyone have any help?

Sorry if this isn't the best place to post this, but I really love the game and I desperately want to get past this point so its really frustrating. Thanks so much.

Ever since I finished LiS, all over the place I see bae&gt;bay. I personally chose bay&gt;bae and did not regret it. Maybe it's because of my "greater good" ideals or my undying love for Kate Marsh, but surely I can't be the only one that killed Chloe for the sake of the Bay? 
/////////////////////
I see a lot of wallpapers featuring Max and Chloe, but I don't like having a busy picture as my phone background. Has anyone made or found a good picture of the butterfly, preferably in 1440x2560?

A couple months ago, [a thread started on](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/41aiy9/the_rlis_musical_choir_sign_up_now/) /r/lifeisstrange about putting together a series of performances of songs from LiS sung by fans and followers who came together online.

And nothing came of it. So I'm picking up the ball because I was really interested in the idea and don't want to see it fall through. That said, I'll be trying until I can't to make this project successful.

I'm looking for anyone willing to have a little fun and sing with us all. You don't have to be a pro or even good at singing, but just willing to have fun and laugh it off if you want. It'll be awesome. Pick any song you want from LiS, and as many as you want, and just record yourself singing. I'll put as many tracks together as I have submissions for. 

Your microphone doesn't even have to be great. I found that the mic that comes with those standard iPhone head phones is pretty decent in a quiet room. (But obviously the better audio quality, the better).

If you're interested, even record video so I can put together a video version when everything is all said and done. I imagine [it'll look something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj1YhlEmXkw). 

Please email me at michaelajohnpoll@gmail.com to submit vocals and videos. If your files are too large for email, please consider submitting them via Dropbox or another file sharing service; there are plenty of free, legitimate sharing services out there. 

Hope to hear from you soon!

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents. Today we shall have a topic about:

Did your taste in music/games/books/whatever change after playing LiS?
/////////////////////
I posted a few weekends ago after playing through to halfway through episode 4 in one sitting. I finally got up the courage to finish tonight. I wish I hadn't.


I got so caught up in the moment and what Chloe was saying, that I did what she said and chose to sacrifice her. I sat with that choice screen open for like ten minutes just angrily crying at it.


Seeing the train tracks photo (my favourite) burn I knew I'd made the wrong choice! Fuck! Then seeing Joyce, and realising she had now lost her husband and her daughter, I definitely knew I shouldn't have done it. God damn it. What a fucking game. I won't be replaying that in a hurry.
/////////////////////
Howdy everyone, I've been working on a genderbent chloe cosplay and I have the entire outfit (as well as the tattoo and wig) ready to go. The last thing I need is chloe's jacket/overshirt. I know she wears a 3/4 sleeve blazer but that is traditionally a woman's wardrobe item. In terms of changing the cosplay for a dude, I'm not sure what to wear. I have a black, military-styled shirt that I can roll the sleeves up with, but it's not really a jacket. A full men's blazer wouldn't work, as the sleeves can't easily be rolled up and I haven't been able to find a 3/4 sleeve men's blazer. If anyone could lend some advice or suggestions, I'd grealy appreciate it.  
Here's a picture of the WIP cosplay with the shirt I already have (Yes, I'll be shaving and I have contacts) http://imgur.com/j3v9roy
/////////////////////
There are incredible big moments throughout -- the end of Episode 3, Chloe finding Rachel's body, the Bay ending -- but I'm wondering what subtle moments stuck with people the most, moments that might not get talked about a lot.

One of those moments for me is when Max says "Drink up, Buttercup" in Episode 4. Her voice sounds so tender and so overwhelmed.

Hi everybody,

I've never played this game or seen any gameplay, I'm wanting to go in not knowing much. I'm planning on playing it with my girlfriend who is not much of a gamer at all, and ideally I'd like her to be the one doing the playing. However she has no experience with videogame mechanics, so I'm wondering if this game has any time-sensitive mechanics like quick time events, having to aim and shoot within a time limit, that kind of thing. Time limited dialogue choices and basic movement would be fine. I've seen mixed responses from Googling but I've avoided reading to much for fear of spoilers.

Thanks!


tl;dr: Are there QTEs or other time limited mechanics?
/////////////////////
I just realised that I am happy. Playing this game has made me happy. I am happy when in the game Max is viewing the Pacific Ocean. I am happy that I could find eventually a peaceful solution to obtain the client list from the drug dealer. I am happy when putting the clues together at Chloe's room. This game has given me so much of good memories. And it's something I'd rarely ever play. I'm about the double the age of Max, I've never been in USA, nor in art school, and I'm a male. Yet, this game manages to have an impact to me the way I described. And I'm looking now Google Maps of the coast line of Oregon. 

I love how the game lets me to make wrong to right. I let's me try as long as I get the satisfying result. I regret that I had made Victoria angry before so she didn't believe me when I warned her about the dark room at the party. 

I love how small things like "Always take a picture" become most important things in the game (allowing Max to escape and return to the moment where all this mess started). I love the small things like license plate, TWNPKS &gt; Twin Peaks. (And I love Twin Peaks as well, at least the four first episodes, but not the entire series). And it's interesting how this game is presenting elements that could be connected - dead whales, Nathan listening singing of whales, Nathan gets killed. 

I love the change of tone the game has - from the depressive mood from the first time at junk yard. I had a feeling that this game is so depressing. It felt that the time is still, nothing happens, these people are trapped in this city and no one is happy. But then the new game mechanics was introduced - going back in time through photos and the plot started to become more shocking. 

I love how Max can let Warren to beat the shit out of Nathan. I love the game tells the personalities of the people indirectly via their drug use (after you've obtained the client list). And I love at one of climax of the game, when Chloe and Max finally find Rachel, one very familiar song to me is playing at the background. I discovered Message to Bears from Spotify when I made a radio from a Reel Life (Evolution II) - a song by Cinematic Orchestra. I loved the strange vibe of Mountains but after hearing it in the game at this specific scene - I feel I can't listen the song anymore the way I did before. The song has now new meaning. Much darker, much different than before. 

So this is what I want to leave for this community here and I guess there are a lot of people like me who got the same unforgettable memories from this game. 
/////////////////////
Wow. I'm still trying to process everything that just happened. It was definitely a roller coaster. 

Fucking Mr. Jefferson! What a creepy prick! The only thing I regret is that I didn't get to bash his skull in myself. I had a feeling warning Victoria was going to get her killed after Jefferson was revealed as the bad guy. I let David shoot the bastard, normally I wouldn't make a decision like that, but fuck Jefferson. 

I gotta say I loved the moment and first optional photo of Kate when you go back to Jefferson's class. Kate is still my favorite character in the game (and I don't even think it's close).

Now on to the ending. It was very emotional, don't get me wrong, but it did not have the full impact on me. I figured out about half way through that the ending would somehow involve the first picture of the butterfly you took. Also, I just never really connected that much with Chloe. She was actually kind of far down the list of characters I liked. With all that said, it was an easy choice for me to sacrifice her for the good of Arcadia Bay (more specifically Kate :) and to an extent Victoria).

Seeing Max in those last sequences though was very emotional. She fought so hard to save Chloe, only to realize fate was going to fight back. Watching her cry in the bathroom while Chloe bled out was heartbreaking. Very powerful image. It was a very somber ending. 

Overall this game was amazing. I had a blast playing it, and the connection to the characters in this game is immense. I think the saddest part is that it's over.

So what decisions did you make in EP 5? What were your thoughts? What really hit you the hardest? 

Thanks for being here with me on this wild ride! I can finally click on all the threads!

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents. Today, we shall have a topic about:

How morally challenging did you find LiS? Why?
/////////////////////
I guess of lot of people already know this but I just found out that Chloe and Tiny Tina from Borderlands 2 are voiced by the same person. This is very interesting to me since Tiny Tina sounds and talks very differently from Chloe. And both Life is Strange and Borderlands 2 are in my favorite games of all time list. Huh. Interesting.


Pretty much it, really lol
/////////////////////
My 12 year old daughter is a big fan of the game, and has really seemed to get attached to it more than most things she's played or watched. I'm thinking about getting her some gifts or something related to it for her birthday, but I'm not sure what's out there. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas? Even tangentially related things you might think would be cool to have as a fan. 


Thanks!
/////////////////////
What worked for you? 
I'm lookin for deep, emotional, with complex charcters games. the kind of game doesnt really matter.

the last of us? heavy rain?

Carry On ("Life is Strange" Tribute) feat. Koethe
/////////////////////
So I was replaying the game mostly to take all the photos and to try some different choices (did almost everything as in the first playthrough anyway, ha ha). And I can't explain this:  
When Max goes through the Warren's photo, she convices Chloe to not go to the party and to say everything to David. Then Max says something like: "I will be gone in a second, you have to say everything to me what I've just said to you."  She then "wakes" on the stormy beach right before her nightmare.  
Why? How come she doesn't remember? Where was she? She could've warned everyone about the storm. I am confused about all this. Please help.  
  
edit: why are you downvoting everything I write? Did i offend anyone? Now I feel just bad for asking..

#Warning: Spoilers Ahead

&amp;nbsp;

Hey everyone! I would just like to take time to show appreciation to the love that the players give to this sub (and to the game, most importantly) by contributing in ways that I can. I haven't really ran into  *"When was this song played during the game?"* 
thread and I figured some players may take interest into it as well. 

&amp;nbsp;

That said, I paid more attention on my 2nd playthrough to come up with this list and I hope you like it. I have listed the song title (with a link), its Artist and Episode(s) in which they were used in the game. Sure there are spoilers but I've kept them as vague as possible (except the ending) so please if you are new to this game just read at your own risk. The youtube playlist had 'Power to Progress' in which was not in the game but I have included it in anyway because it is a great song as well.

So I was hanging out with some friends this afternoon. We decided to go up to the roof for a smoke, and BOOM! Triggered!

Any places where you guys unexpectedly had feels flashbacks?
/////////////////////
I just finished my first play through (my god, what an ending), and although I didn't do everything I would have like, it feels like it was perfect (in a sense that it felt human and flawed). 

I went with the sacrifice Chloe ending ( :( ) and although it wasn't the ending I planned on making it seems right (for now).

This game has given me (a 26 year old male) some major feels, and it's going to take a while for me to get over it (and potentially do another play through).
/////////////////////
I mean, I want to listen to it 24/7 but I'm afraid that if I do, I'll just become numb to it and eventually after listening to it too much, I'll lose that connection/feel I have for the game and soundtrack to where the songs will just become noise (I don't know if that makes sense lol)

Phack
/////////////////////
Does anyone know of a place that sells just the art book, or maybe a site that has a PDF version?
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back, guys and girls! Today, we shall have a topic about:

If you had to describe LiS with one emotion, what would it be?
/////////////////////
I finally played the sacrifice Chloe option and I feel like I played my version of the perfect game.  Onions were cut. I sat in silence for a while.  I moved on. I still think about it.  But I don't think I could ever play again. I feel like it would ruin the authenticity of my emotions built with the characters' growths and developments and lives and deaths.  Anyone else?
/////////////////////
It's one of my personal favorites on the soundtrack, right next to "Golden Hour" and "Obstacles". Sooo, good! I listen to them when I'm browsing Reddit or trying to fall asleep. Really relaxes the mind, body, and soul :) 🎵🎶
/////////////////////
What a ride. So I was coming into this episode ready for some intense shit thanks to comments on this sub. I wasn't disappointed, and thankfully was able to brace myself. 

Let's start at the beginning. I knew when Chloe was talking about her condition worsening that she was going to ask Max to euthanize her. I actually threw my controller onto my bed, and put my head down to collect myself for a moment. It was some pretty heavy shit. Of course I refused, no way was I going to pull the plug. I'll have to go back and see how it works out that way. 

I was really happy to be back in the original timeline. The Frank convo was fun, and I'm glad I rewinded a bunch to get him on our good side. He's not that bad of a person if he could put his drug dealing aside and get an honest job. 

Next up is Kate, my girl! I was ~~so~~ hella happy Max got to visit her. My heart melted (and she got her big ole hug)! I didn't believe for a second she was chihuahua on Frank's list (I'm happy the devs confirmed that wasn't her). 

I'm glad Max and Victoria got to patch things up a bit. I know she can be a bitch at times, but I don't think Victoria is that bad.

And now the ending, holy shit, that was crazy. It was Mr. Jefferson the whole time! Poor Rachel Amber :( I'm wondering if she was killed on purpose, or was it an accident. I don't think Nathan is 100% innocent. It's possible he is working under Jefferson, or that he knows too much and Jefferson is threatening him. I don't think Chloe is dead for good yet. That end just seemed off for it to be the death of the second biggest character in the game. 

So what were your thoughts on episode 4? What should I do to prepare myself for the finally. This game has been incredible thus far, I hope it has an ending (well at least some endings) fit for the rest of the game. I got called into work tomorrow so I won't be able to finish until tomorrow night.

Edit: I won't be back until tonight, so I'll make sure to answer anyone who comments then!

I know All To You plays in the first hallway scene. Crosses via Max's radio. And Obstacles at the end of the episode. I don't know what song Chloe plays to rock out in her room. Episode 2 has Mt Washington at the end. Episode 4 has Get Well Soon at the Party.  Episode 5 has Spanish Sahara. What about all the others?

Edit: Something Good is the Ep2 starting song. Forgot about that.
/////////////////////
I finished this amazing game a few days and just wanted talk a bit about the last episode. I thought it was very well done.

[EP5 SPOILERS](#s "I'm talking about the starting of Max's nightmare. It was so well done. The part when it starts with the blood on the windows, the door opening to revealing endless corridors, Kate sobbing, the transition from Max sitting on the bench into the snow globe, etc. Damn. I was starting to think that maybe Max is a patient in an asylum somewhere who had imagined this ENTIRE thing. The whole nightmare sequence was so ominous and eerie.")

[](#s "EDIT: Oh, and all those text messages as well. What a well crafted mind-fuck.")

/////////////////////
WHAT. WHAT?

This episode. Alt-Chloe. Pulling the plug. Restarting my conversation with Frank eight times until nobody got hurt. Finding the creepy Dexter room. Finding Rachel. Then I'M DRUGGED, CHLOE IS DEAD AND MR JEFFERSON IS THE CULPRIT? 

CHLOE

I can't. This was too intense. Ep 5 tomorrow.....
/////////////////////
I have been playing Life is Strange for a couple of months without any issues. The game is installed on my PC in Steam, and I play it with Steam Link and a wireless xbox360 controller with a wireless USB dongle. I have played through the first four episodes and am currently about halfway through the fifth episode.

The other night I started it up to finish the game (which is AMAZING so far and I am ready to get to the conclusion), and  the controller suddenly isn't being recognized and I can't get past the "press any button" screen with input other than the mouse and keyboard.

My controller works in every other game on steam link without problems, so I'm fairly sure the problem lies with the game.   
/////////////////////
A friend of mine is playing LiS. It was me who made the suggestion. 

He loves every piece of media capable of conveying deep feelings, be it a game, a movie, or an anime series. He absolutely trusts my suggestions, he's never been disappointed.

Like many of us, he went through trauma. It left him a pretty sensitive, emotional person.

When I finished LiS, I told him he absolutely had to play it. I just warned him it was gonna be *very* intense.

He just finished Episode 1. He said the final scene, Max and Chloe reconnecting by the lighthouse, moved him. And by "moved" I mean he almost cried.

LiS left me an emotional wreck. Still am after almost a month, goddammit, and I'm on the insensitive side of the emotional spectrum. It's the first time something made me feel that way.

But what about him? Based on his reaction after Episode 1, I don't know what to expect.

Did anyone of you have a similar experience?
/////////////////////
Was there any specific artist who did that work? It was the drawing hung up in the dark room. 
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents. Today, we shall have a topic about:

Every company has its own style. How different LiS would be if it was made by some of the best known gaming companies out there? (for example, Ubisoft, Bethesda, etc.)
/////////////////////
I have never played a gave that actually made me cry, and I'm not easy to break down in tears. 

I made another post yesterday of finishing Episode 3. Here it is:

. In that post, I basically explained my thoughts and worries about the end of the game, but now that I've finished it, I'm in shock. 

I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The art style, character development, music, graphics, the rewinding mechanic, the small attention to detail...IT'S SO GOOD! 

There is just so much life put into this game! (Pun intended) It's crazy! That said, I have a few final thoughts on the game:

-I did NOT see that coming. Mr. Jefferson seemed really cool and chill. Out of ALL people, I did not expect him to be the one behind all this.

-I chose to "sacrifice Arcadia bay". After all the hell Max had to go through to save Chloe's ass, I felt that if Chloe goes, we all go. Still cried when I saw this option :(

-If there is a sequel, I'd like to see Chloe and Max go on another adventure (Sacrifice Arcadia bay) /Max and Warren go on an adventure (Sacrifice Chloe).

-Or for that matter, have there be a prequel where we actually get to see Rachel Amber and we are in Chloe's Perspective. I think that'd be cool!

Nonetheless, this game is NOW my all time favorite game. It definitely beat Pokemon Crystal and Ocarina of time, imo.

It's a good thing I bought the Limited edition :) I can listen to the entire soundtrack over and over again. 

Thank you Dontnod and Square Enix for making this masterpiece possible! :)

Edit: Looking at the games global choice options, I'm surprised that the majority didn't figure out Nathan's password. I thought it was required to progress: it's always the birthday :)

I finished playing Life is Strange three days ago and I am still feeling "the feels"...a sense of profound wonderment mixed with a tinge of sadness and a whole lot of catharsis.

I am sure I am not the only one who felt this way. 

Now there is a hole in my heart...how do you guys move on from such a masterpiece as this game?
/////////////////////
I'm hoping someone might have a link to or a copy of the text from Max's journal or even screenshots of all the pages (I know there's a few of the pages out there like the last two and the ones from the Alt!Universe).  

It would save me having to do it myself if there was already a copy out there of this. If not then I'll do it at some point and upload them if I get the chance.
/////////////////////
Hi everyone! I really enjoyed LiS and - as I've learned from this subreddit - many people seem to like the game for the same reasons as I did. However, there was one thing about it that really annoyed me and so far I haven't seen anyone discussing it:

Right from the start I noticed that nearly everyone in that game - especially the girls - is very slim/thin. I mean look at the girls at that school... Alyssa is the only exception and though she doesn't seem very overweight to me, she stands out as rather big among all those skinny girls.

Now why does that bother me so much?

I think what makes this game so special is that people - especially young people - can learn a lot from it. The many decisions you have to make and their consequences gives you a good impression of how our everyday actions both affect and are affected by the thoughts and feelings of others. (Other redditors have expressed this many times before and in much more eloquence than me. I suppose you see what I mean if you played or watched LiS.) I got the impression that one reason why LiS works so well is that many people strongly identify with the characters, especially with Max and Chloe of course. And now look at them: Both are very thin and I can't help but think of Chloe as potentially anorexic. (Btw: That could have made for a great side-plot: Chloe being driven into anorexia by the distress of loosing Rachel, feeling like she failed and had been failed by Max.)

Let me clarify that I do not think that all/most very skinny girls are unhealthy or something. I just think that this game - while being very instructive and inspiring in many ways - might influence young people who are insecure about their body in a bad way. Of course there are so many movies, games and whatnot that gives you a bad impression of what an average or healthy body shape/weight is. It just irritates me a lot that DONTNOD weren't very sensitive about this issue while emphasizing so strongly the importance of empathy, respect for the individual, and altruism.

So now what do you think about this? Am I overreacting to just another instance of a very widespread problem or did you think the same thing while playing LiS?

EDIT: Hmm I seem to be off the track here... Thanks to u/Soviet_Creeper and u/not_so_virgin_mary for explaining their point of view.

A friend posted this on facebook and it connected with all the stuff I had been thinking about Life is Strange.

(Though to be fair my shopping list makes me think about Life is Strange so the connection may be less than valid)

“People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life. 

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and then leave. 

A soul mates purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your spiritual master...”

So I just Watched whatmojo's Top 10 Episodic Video Games and I thought it would be interesting to know your thoughts about your top 5.So here is my list:

5)The Wolf Among US

4)Tales From The Borderlands

3)The Walking Dead:Season 1

2)The Walking Dead:Season 2

1)Life Is Strange

((These are actually the only episodic games I played.So if it not really creative,I apologize.))

Edit:I think everyone is going to kill me because I loved season 2 of TWD more than it's season 1 :D 
/////////////////////
So I'm going to preface this by saying that I began by redoing the final decision in Episode 2. I blamed Jefferson instead of Nathan. I decided to do this because my initial choice was going to be to blame him. I knew I didn't want to blame Madsen because I wasn't too nice to him, and he could hang the pot over me. Originally I didn't want to blame Nathan because of the warnings from him and his father. However, I read a lot of other peoples thoughts, and some spoilers and said fuck it, and blamed Nathan. I went back to Jefferson to make it feel more like what would have happened had I not looked ahead. Anyway, on to episode 3!

All I have to say is WHAT THE FUCK! 

Feels wise the episode was pretty light. However, that ending was a total mind fuck. I literally was just saying "what the fuck" during the entire credits (the swear jar is going to be pretty full). I was expecting William to die anyway, showing that there are some things you can't change. But this would leave Chloe resenting Max because she told William to take the bus. Instead they left it completely changed. Now, I don't expect it to last like this, because it just feels like changing the game a little too much. I guess I could be wrong. I'm very glad to have the opportunity to play the next episode tomorrow. It was hella cruel of Dontnod to keep people hanging for months with the end of that episode, it took a lot of strength to not just jump right into episode 4.

Now some minor things. I kind of wish Kate was in the episode (girl needs a big ole hug). She's still my favorite character, my eyes lit up when she texted Max. I really hope we get to at least visit her in the hospital (if we even go back to the original timeline, since Max is in the vortex club in the alternate timeline I would assume her and Kate wouldn't be friends).

Which now brings me to Max, she is such an endearing character. She's 100% dork, and I love it. I would totally be bffs with her, even if she doesn't like crunchy peanut butter. I think what makes Life is Strange work so well is the characters seem real. It just immerses you into the life of Max Caulfield. 

It does a great job of painting all the characters as human. The characters have real depth to them. They could have easily just kept Taylor as Victoria's cronie, and not had any development at all. But even then the game shows you it's a lot deeper than that.

Damn! This game so good! The character development, the story, the art style, the music, the rewinding in time mechanic....it's just so well polished! I am actually going to go out on a limb here and say this game is my all time favorite game! Right next to pokemon crystal and ocarina of time! It's that damn good, imo!

I love that this game can have multiple endings! It just adds to the game's uniqueness!

That said I do have a few concerns:

 1. Does anyone die, no matter what choices you make?! If so, how many? (Please don't name names!)

 2. This is a spoiler: 

Looking at the world stats for the game decisions for episode 3, I see that a majority chose "kiss chloe". I, however, did not. Does this affect the outcome of the game? (Yes or No answer only)

 1. This is also a spoiler:

I also noticed that the world majority chose the option of "taking back David's gun" in Frank's RV, that Chloe originally took. I, however, did not simply because I remember there were no bullets in that gun and Frank seems like a dumbass. Does this affect my outcome negatively?(Yes or No answers please!)

Also, a little off topic, but are there more games that involve choices and consequences like this game? I'd love to know the names of them! :) This game is like Netflix with a controller! :)

Edit: playing this on my PS4
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back, guys and girls! Today, we shall have a topic about:

If you had to rename all LiS characters, what names would you pick for them?
/////////////////////
I feel bad about saying this... but I really hope he won't do a game theory-video about Life is Stange. I mean he most likely will, and I'm scared about it. Here's why:
In short it will harm Life is Strange and DONTNOD. The Game Theorists is one of the biggest gaming-related YouTube-channel, with about 6 million subs. So many, many people who havent played the game will see his theory-video and therefore have their first glance of the game from his piont of view (to some extend at least). 

Now I don't want to say that his point of view is bad or anything, but maybe MatPat and Life is Strange just don't suit very well. I feel like he couldn't commit to the slow pacing of the game. You know... like skipping most of the dialogs or talking over them, missing out on a lot of stuff, allways getting up as soon as possible (when you have the option 'sit down' or the in the bed with Chloe after breaking into Blackwell), and just generally complaining about everything. Now I don't mind him really disliking Chloe, but to quote [GCN](https://youtu.be/RJAEVBf5Q_Q?t=27m55s) : " You have to REALLY hate Chloe or be a homophibic douchebag to pick the 'don't kiss Chloe' option". And he did. ON VALENTINES DAY come on! Even his wife (are they married?) said "You are a horrible, horrible person".
Now I don't think thats true, still love you MatPat &lt;3 But please be very carefull about makeing (one of) the most watched Life is Strange-related Video, and be aware of the impact you can have. But hey maybe I'm wrong about all of this and he will just do a hella good theory.
/////////////////////
Hi all,

  I heard about this game on TIFU and was intrigued of how emotionally powerful it seemed to affect most of the comments in the thread, so I picked it up. I am sucker for a good story with great soundtrack accompanying the video game. Games like Undertale and Last of Us for example.

This game shocked me. I was completely blind to the storyline and loved the rewind aspect in the gameplay. The high school drama did kinda put me off, but the lead up to episode 4 made up for it all. I am posting this thread because I want to play another game other than Rocket League in my spare time that would be this amazing. Great story and amazing soundtrack are my parameters. Thanks.

What is your favourite LiS artwork?
I think for me - this:

/////////////////////
How do I go on living an everyday life after this game emotionally broke me?
/////////////////////
Hello, Life is Strange Subreddit. This is my first post here (and Reddit in general, so please excuse any mistakes) after lurking for months, since last August. But I felt a need to share my story, and why this game is so very important to me.

I bought this game for one of my best friend's for his birthday. I wanted to play it as well, and since he was working when I got it for him, I dove right into playing. I was hooked from the start.

Even though I'm 23, it felt like I was in high school all over again. I relate and see myself in so many characters...Max, Chloe, Kate, and more. I finished the game on October 20th, and it became one of my favorite games. It had already changed my life. But what I didn't know, however, was how much it was going to mean to me a month and six days after finishing the game.

November 26th, 2015, my life changed forever. On that day, on Thanksgiving...I had found out a childhood best friend of mine had been brutally murdered the day before.

She and I were best friends for about six years. We'd hang out at each other's houses, talk on the phone for hours upon hours, the things that friends normally do together. I had helped her with serious issues, and we'd spend hours just laughing together. We drifted apart during high school, but I had looked her up on Facebook about a week or two before she died. I didn't find anything on her, and then...she died. I'm from a very small town, so the news was everywhere fast. 

Now, I'm writing this for a few reasons. Firstly, that friend that I bought the game for is going to play Episode 5 tonight. In my playthrough, I saved Chloe. In case he chooses the Bay ending, I chose to watch it today. I sort of just numbly watched it...and then it hit me when it was over why this game means so much to me on a very strong, emotional level. 

It means so much to me because Max and Chloe got to have more time together, reconnecting after five years. I'll never have that with my friend that died. It hurts so much to think that. I think about her every day, and I still can't believe what happened. Today also happens to be--or, would have been...her 23rd birthday. 

The other day, I had thought about Life is Strange. The pretrial hearing for the person who murdered my friend took place. I was looking for news about it all day. When I was feeling sad, a bird flew up and sat on the windowsill for a few seconds outside. It looked around for a few seconds, and it was beautiful. I wanted to take a picture of it, but it flew away before I could. Maybe it was a sign of some sort. 

Writing this post has brought forth a whole bunch of emotions, but the one thing I can take as comfort from watching the other ending was the line, "The moments between us were real. And they'll always be ours." 

I feel like the words I'm writing here don't cover what I'm feeling. I don't know if it makes sense, or if anyone will even read it. I just wanted to let my feelings out in a place where people may understand, and where people love this game as much as I do. 

Thank you for reading, and listening. It means the world to me. &lt;3  
/////////////////////
If it's Chloe's "spirit animal" then why did it appear before she died?

Why were there so many flying over the cliff and during the funeral?

And if the doe is Rachel's, which is transparent, then shouldn't the butterfly appear transparent after she died?

Does it allude to the literal butterfly effect?

Is it more of a metaphor than a symbol? I think it's used so repetitively to set a mood... for something.

How do you see it and why?
/////////////////////
And out of the blue I had Obstacles come up. I havent actually heard it since I finished LiS. And it kinda hit me with a brick wall of feel. 

Thing is, I really didnt feel too emotional at the end. Not like I expected anyway.  But while I was listening I just stopped amd reflected on the story. And just kinda sat and had the moment I DID expect; a metric- fuck ton of feels. LiS was quite the game, and the best impulse choice I ever had. Arcadia Bay will be in my heart and mind forever probably. 

Stay Hella ya'll..,
/////////////////////
Just wondering how everyone's experiences went in their second playthough now that I think it's safe to assume we've all had one.
/////////////////////
So I just watched the final episode of MatPat's (from Game Theory) live stream of LiS. They picked the Bay ending, and their emotions were genuine, they were tearing up, and moaning, I really liked that they weren't trying to act like they are above that. Of course I was crying as well and I wasn't even the one who was playing, but that ending just always gets me. I'm a Bae guy, so I don't see the Bay ending very often, but watching it again just reminded me how amazingly directed and choreographed it is. The lighting, the camera angles, the pacing, the music, just perfect. Yes, of course the Bae ending is well directed as well, with great angles, but because it's shorter, it has less time for great shots. The problem is, seeing the Bay ending made me feel empty inside again. I guess I'll just have to play through the game for the 4th time and save Chloe again to feel happy (or at least not as empty).

Edit: I reread the post, and realized I got a little off track by the end, so the title may be a little misleading. Sorry about that.
/////////////////////
Hey guys. I heard this rumor from a friend a few weeks ago that the producers confirmed there was going to have a Season 2 of LiS. Have you heard of this? Do you know if it's true?
Links would be much appreciated.
/////////////////////
If you get Max suspended, Max can't go to class anymore which means...

More Pricefield time offscreen! Plus the tornado comes anyway, so its like all her records of being suspended get destoryed, so there's no long term consequences on her future.
/////////////////////
I played through Life is Strange because I had a week left on my Gamefly trial and it looked like fun.

Throughout the game, I felt myself getting emotional, and I couldn't put my finger on it.  Then I finished it and it hit me.

My friend was one of the closest people to me. We'd fall asleep in each other's arms, hold hands when we walked everywhere, have sex, drink, watch old movies on my bed.  She was tough.  Tattooed, pierced, but one of the most genuine individuals I've had the privilege to have in my life.  One day she told me she'd love me until the day she wasn't here anymore.

Then she wasn't.  She suddenly died of a drug overdose.  All of the sudden, I was alone, and the person that mattered most was no longer a part of my life.  I'll never hear her laugh again.  I'll never hold her hand again.  I'll never wake her up with a kiss on the forehead again.  I'll never fall asleep with her next to me again.

And it was in that moment, I realized that Chloe was the embodiment of my friend.  Troubled with a hard life, in with a bad crowd, lost important people, had trouble getting along with most, but with a truly good heart.  And like Chloe truly loved Max, I know in my heart that she truly loved me.  In every moment I played, I felt like I did trying to save her from herself and the world around her.  The world that eventually took her.

Given the choice, I would have destroyed everything around me to save her life.  I understand so well the feelings that come with wanting to change the world to have a life with that person.

Sorry if this is a bit of a downer.  This is a throwaway.  I considered posting on my main, but given how much of my identity is on there, I can't bring myself to do it.  Thank you for reading.
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents! Today, we shall have a topic about:

What symbolism in LiS was the best to you, personally? Why?
/////////////////////
It has been a couple of days since the end of my 2nd play through of LiS (I didn't play anything else between the 1st and 2nd play).

I think I'm ready to start seeing other games now...

Anything character/story driven is going to feel weak in comparison, so I'm thinking about something that engages other bits of the brain - a puzzle or pure action thing.

What did you play next?
/////////////////////
Considering she was trowing herself a few days ago.
/////////////////////
Created an account for the sole purpose of posting this.

I finished playing the entire thing a couple of days ago. All episodes. Even though this isn't my type of game, I could not help but to love the whole thing. I picked it up a few days ago when I saw all episodes were available for 10 dollars on the xbox live gold deals and I just hopped on the thing without knowing what I was getting myself into.

The game looks great. The whole atmosphere brings me back to my own highschool years. The music, again, isn't really my style, but I enjoyed it anyways since it is a really important aspect of said atmosphere.

Now, this is where I have a problem. Max and Chloe are too damn lovely! They aren't just reaaaaaaaally pretty but their styles and personalities (at least according to the choices made on my own playthrough) made me literally fall in love with them!

Now, it's not the first time this happens to me but it's been years since I felt something similar. Now I often find myself daydreaming about either of them.

I need them in my life! Hell, I wouldn't even mind being friendzoned as long as they're around. I'm definately replaying this game...
/////////////////////
**LONG POST! I THINK! HEAVILY SPOILER-RIDDEN! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE GAME!
TAGGED FOR EP 1 BECAUSE IT'S EP 1-5 IN THIS. HOPE THIS IS OK!**

*Hi!* I'm not sure if I'm exactly doing this right, but I wanted to express my thoughts about Life is Strange, how the plot concluded, what my choice in the end was, and what I've felt before, during and after playing this game.

I'm not going to lie to you. At first (a year or so ago!) when I saw the game, I thought; &gt;"Bleh! Just another game trying to make it through with what Telltale has been doing! Probably WAY worse than Telltale as well!"

And I've started seeing more and more of my friends playing this game. Naturally, it'd intrigue your average person as to why so many people are playing the game? But it didn't really bother me all that much.

A year slipped by, and a friendship I've had (much similar to Max's and Chloe's!) withered away. It went off, after countless efforts to salvage it, but it died in the end. It had to end, but that's how life is. Sometimes, you gotta let go of things, even if it's not too pleasant to do so at the time. 

So... a bit before Christmas 2015, a friend of mine shared his Steam library with me. He's got a ton of stuff, but honestly - I never really bothered with any of the games. I tried HELLDIVERS, and dropped it after launching it once. I don't know, didn't feel like it. It was mostly him playing my games - which was part of the agreement and I'm still O.K. with it. 

Well - about two weeks ago, I decide to try something new. I have a bit of alcohol, and I see Life Is Strange™ sitting in his library. His library isn't in use, I say "Screw it." and I download it. It doesn't take me too long, and I decide to dive into it. I get some alcohol and my favourite snacks and I fire it up. I read the how-to-play and adjust the options and off I go.

I start off in Jefferson's class. I don't really pay attention to what he says during it. I thought it was just a boring intro, so I decided not to pay full attention, until the first interactive bit. I do all that stuff, and then you meet Chloe in the bathroom! You know, first encounter and all. And I think;"Wow! This person seems familiar!" (character/personality-wise)

I watch through it, plot goes on - I start getting really into it. It feels like a really intense show. I draw to the conclusion of EP1. The game prompts up the "Buy Episode 2!" or whatever. Oh boy. No!

It can't be like THIS. I WANT TO PLAY THIS SO BAD.

At that point, my heart and soul was invested into the story. I already fell in love with this ~~game~~ work of art, and I was **so** gripped that I just could **not** let go of it. Not this easily. I tell my friend what an adventure and a blast I've had. Since it's family-share, he owns the game and I don't.

I have to tell him. I tell him how much I already love Life is Strange, how much I can relate to the characters. Half-drunk, I tell him;
"Dude, you **HAVE** to buy the other episodes! I **REALLY** want to play this! PLEASE buy them for me! It'll be the best thing ever!"

I don't think anything comes of it, so I already planned on ditching my hopes of getting a drawing tablet, just so I could purchase LiS (all episodes) and enjoy the emotional rollercoaster.

Tomorrow, I wake up to what possibly are some of the best news I've heard lately.
"Hey, I bought the rest of the episodes. Enjoy!" -- I felt quite euphoric, actually! And I saw this on mobile Steam, so I hopped right on my PC to download it. I decided not to play it during the day. I really didn't want anyone or anything walking in and seeing me crying. *I had a hunch that I'd CRY*, and that's what made me play it at night.

I realized, though, that I lack the snacks for this endeavor. And alcohol, which definitely amplifies the emotion output by a good 200%! With around $8-ish in my pocket, I head out to a shop and buy myself snacks and alcohol. Woop... I put the stuff in the fridge, and it's time to wait until tonight. I chat with my RL friend and tell him how I found this amazing thing and how he should check it out.

He shrugged it off, having the initial reaction which 100% matched mine. Lack of interest, and a question; "Why do people even play this game?"
I decided not to press the manner further. I said; "Alright." and left it at that. 

Finally, Nightfall! It's time for Episode 2!

Out of Time starts. I grow more and more immersed, looking left and right for stuff, thinking about Chloe and Max... and what it could all be like. I think more about the characters - and how they feel, and all. Unfortunately... things with Kate Marsh didn't really work too well. At least Max managed to convince Chloe that she *can* time-travel. But, she still couldn't save Kate. Maybe taking that picture would have changed things. I don't know, but I'm going to re-play the game to find out. As soon as I get some money for snacks.

After Kate's suicide, I feel down. **VERY** down. I think about my experiences during education, I think about the people I've been with, and I feel very glad I didn't end up like Kate. I definitely feel awful because of it, though. I really wish I could have saved her. I mean - I definitely related to Kate. From the EP.1 - when the paper bit was thrown at her. I've, unfortunately, *just like many others* been there. Thankfully, it's all behind me now and it's made me a stronger person.

EP2 passes by, Max saves Chloe and all that, Alyssa - I always warned, and grew to like this cute ball of fun. C'mon, there *had* to be an Alyssa in your life!

There comes EP3, it's been a few days since I last played. I had work and what not, so I've been a bit busy. Finally, time to simmer down and continue the beautiful journey through time. (Pun intended!)

Chaos Theory rolls in!

Things happen, I still feel very bad about Kate. I wish I could rewind time... it'd be easy, right? So I thought as I played the game. 
Chloe and Max break into Blackwell and check Mr. Wells' office, snooping around like the great detectives they are. Chloe keeps mentioning Max's powers, and think it's all that simple. Like, I believe - many of us thought at first as well.

They find clues on the computer and in the files, along with Nathan's scribbling; *Rachel in the Dark Room* repeated over and over again. Now, someone smarter than me likely connected Jefferson's quote; 
&gt;"Seriously though, I could frame anyone of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation."

With, well, this. Dark Corner -- Dark Room -- Desperation... the plot was so foreshadowed, but me, being me, I couldn't see it. Same was with MGSV's plot. It was foreshadowed in every song that was known to the public and all, it should have been so predictable, but no. I've realized that too late.

Time passes, Max changes name on the Vortex Club Party list, then Chloe and Max take a dip in the swimming pool.
My heart was racing when they got closer. I could *feel* it. It felt like they were going to kiss and confess love for each other. My heart fluttered so much and I got so excited and happy!

... but it didn't happen. I got a bit disappointed, but I realized that it'd be rather cliche if it went down like that.

The girls leave the place and they go to Chloe's place. Max takes a selfie with Chloe in the morning, and then Chloe gives Max some of Rachel's clothes, urging her to be a rebel. Max wears 'em, and, in my mind, looks really good in them!

David comes home, pretty pissed off. I decide to, after rummaging through his stuff - to side with Chloe and get him kicked out. This happens, David seems pretty pissed... it was at this point when I knew that I kinda relate to him as well. I'll explain a bit later why. I think.

Episode draws to a near-end, Max focuses on the photo in her room and goes back in time. She alters the timeline and makes sure that William stays alive. David is a bus-driver... all seems OK. She's friends with Victoria, who calls her Maxine. She corrects her and says; Max, never Maxine. - and wonders what else she has changed.

She runs off, to Chloe's house. She greets William and William says that Chloe has a visitor.
Chloe rolls towards the door in her wheelchair... I break into tears and hit the ESC button and take a moment to myself.
All I could think to myself was "I knew it.", because I had a hunch, with William alive, something awful would've happened to Chloe instead.

I gather some more courage and willpower to go on, and the episode concludes.
I promptly cry myself to sleep, thinking how a simple thing can change so much. And it can, just imagine every day you've went to school, you were delayed by a minute. Maybe, just maybe you'd meet some interesting people or maybe something would happen.

It's food for thought, I leave that for the shower or bed-time when I'm too busy crying to be coherent. Or even try to.

EP 4 "Chaos Theory" starts. I see the two together on the beach. It's both beautiful, and sad. I remember walking with a friend by the beach like that. But I definitely haven't felt the way Max, or Chloe were feeling. I cried to this already. I *knew* EP 4 was going to wreck me spiritually.

But I had to soldier on. I needed to know what is THERE, I *WANTED* to know about the plot. Damn it, I wanted to know how it unwraps, how it unravels, how their destinies go on, how their fate is woven! At this point, LiS completely bought me. I was fully into it.

Such a small grain of sand can cause such a big mess. It was the butterfly effect, and I couldn't stop crying at this point. I take a sip, soldier on, Val.
*You can do this!* I urged to myself over and over again. I had to trick and cheat myself to continue.

The girls watch Blade Runner together, then Max crashes... in the morning, Chloe asks her for the morphine injector which was upstairs, because of a terrible headache. Max gets her the stuff... plot turns super dark, when Chloe asks Max to OD her. 

...God damn it. Just a moment before that, I managed to stop crying. Chloe begs and insists Max to end her life, telling her she costs her parents something short of a million. Max apologizes to William, then goes back to the original timeline. 

Max finds herself in Chloe's room, hugs her and is VERY glad to have her friend by her side.
They start investigating about Rachel Amber and Kate Marsh. The kickass duo is at it, and they want to get to the bottom of this.

Time passes, stuff happens, Max breaks into Nathan's dorm, takes his phone... you know, you guys played it as well!
Chloe and Max later on find the Dark Room underneath the barn, and they find the red binders. They find that Victoria is next, and they find where Rachel Amber is buried.

Chloe decides to go to the Junkyard, saying she knows the spot where she is. Max goes with her. They get there and find her exactly where the photos have shown.

Max and Chloe decide to go find Nathan. Chloe is **PISSED** and wants to end him.
They don't find Nathan at the party. Max warns Alyssa once more, and Alyssa calls Max her Guardian Angel and then quotes the only poem she knows.

Max goes into the VIP area to find Nathan, but that doesn't work out as Nathan is not there. Then she talks to Victoria, who starts getting really, really bitchy. And I definitely didn't like it, so I said, fuck it. I'm not warning her.

Jefferson then steps up to the podium and declares Victoria the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" contest, who dedicates her victory to Kate Marsh. (Ugh, yeah, right.) I was definitely not too pleased at this point, I was angry at the smug and not sincere gesture.

Chloe and Max head out of the party and to the dormitories, and then Chloe gets a text from Nathan, stating how there'll be no evidence. Max and Chloe flip shit and rush to the junkyard, finding Rachel's body in the same place. Max is drugged and drops to the ground. Desperately trying to warn Chloe, she manages - but it's unfortunately too late. Chloe turns and is shot in the head, dropping dead next to Max.

 Jefferson! NO! My heart was racing and my outlook on everything changed. All this time, I kept blaming Nathan and his family, I thought it was them who did all this. I thought the Dark Room was all for Nathan, just like probably many of you have thought. 

UGH, that PRICK! And I **HONESTLY** liked this guy all along. I thought to myself, after a bit of playing - maybe I would've enjoyed classes a bit more if I had a teacher like Jefferson. Turns out, glad I won't ever get to experience that, right? I'd probably be dead otherwise. '-'

I conclude this night, by once more, crying myself to sleep. How could all this happen? Seriously... fucking HELL. I can't believe I was wrong all along. 

A few nights later, Polarized rolls in. 

Max is tied up and Jefferson is snapping photos of her, just after the recap. Eugh. Fuck.
Time passes as Max and Jefferson talk it out. David comes in through the door, and Max warns him just as Jefferson goes around the corner to grab the tripod.

Never in my life have I been this excited and full of adrenaline in a game similar to this one. 
"GO DAVID! KILL THE MOTHERFUCKER!" I urged to myself quietly, watching with my eyes full of tears as it comes to an end.
*PHEW...* David wins! He unties Max and asks if she's O.K.

I decide to be truthful, so I tell him that Chloe died.
I watch this overly-authoritative, as Chloe called him, step-douche, break down over the loss of his loved step-daughter, to whom he never showed it. He never showed her love like he thought he should have, and that clearly killed him inside. I kinda-sorta broke down too, taking like a ten minute break to cry my soul out.

He was **not** bad! He genuinely loved her, he just killed Jefferson... fuck, shit, I'm very glad that he killed the bastard, but I can't really, you know, let it go like this.

Who knew David was so good and compassionate? I rewind, tell him that Chloe is A-OK and with the most smug smile on my face, I get out of the bunker and I head out. Taking Jefferson's car, Max drives to Two Whales Diner, where she has to meet Warren. He took that self-portrait for prosperity... it's time to use it! It's time to go back in time, it's time to bust Jefferson's ass and save EVERYONE!

...but oh, how wrong I was. Max comes to the storm raging through Arcadia Bay and parks Jefferson's car. People are running, there's a trail of death and destruction everywhere. It was so saddening that I had to muster up the courage to go save Alyssa before moving on. At first, I electrocuted the fisherman, but then I figured out a workaround to that. I don't have to kill everyone... I wouldn't kill anyone, but fuck. This game seriously changed a lot from the ground-up. Everything I was 100% sure about, I was wrong about. It's so weird. I'm usually **really** good at predicting how things will go down. I didn't predict so many twists that I can *relate* to.

Max goes through, shovels some fire sand onto the spreading gasoline-fire which otherwise destroys the diner, and goes to the front door. She doesn't open it, as it's blocked - so she has to go around the diner. Going around the diner, she sees a dead homeless woman. Max condemns herself for not ever asking for her name, for being selfish, and then goes into the diner. She greets Joyce, Warren and others and then she talks to Warren.

Warren confesses his feelings for Max (which were SUPER obvious), and Max says she knows. (OF COURSE YOU KNEW, MAX!) Then, the two kiss. For prosperity, and then Warren thanks her. Max then takes a journey through time, focusing back onto the photograph. 

Max switches through alternate realities - with her and Chloe at the lighthouse in the end, going through the storm together. They talk, Chloe realizes what's causing this and blames it on herself. She says how selfish she has been, and how for once, she should accept her fate.

After a bit of gut-wrenching dialogue (I cried, again.), the action prompt pops up.
Save Arcadia Bay or Save Chloe.

...shit. I looked at the screen with a lot of disbelief. I was really, really sad. 

...

Max rips the photo of the blue butterfly. She tears it up, saving Chloe. I just couldn't let go of someone so precious. I couldn't. I've had something like this going in my life, but I've let go of it and now I have some regrets in my life that I can't undo. I couldn't take this away from Max, nor Chloe - even though it is a game. 

LiS draws to a conclusion, my facial expression is a really sad frown with a lot of tears caking my face.
I've learned something from this game, definitely.

Conclusion below. Sorry, I'm rambling. This probably isn't even interesting past the first paragraph.

**Conclusion:** To conclude this, I want to say how LiS affected me in a way that no other game has. This isn't just about friends, nor is it just about going to school and making it through education. It's much, much more than that. I'd like to quote a Steam review that brought a lot of curiosity when I've seen it.

"But buying it... that's not the hard part.
It's letting go."

And this is about the most accurate review of LiS that I've ever seen. It's not a problem to get the game, it's not a problem to launch and play it. No. It's not a puzzle-game, it's really not that hard. Sometimes you think outside the box, sometimes the game is super easy and right click solves your problems. But, despite it not being a puzzle game, it left me very much puzzled. It hit me hard, like a truck. Primarily because I could relate to both Chloe and Max, but also other characters like David Madsen and Kate Marsh. But also Victoria Chase at some point. 

I mean - I always want to help, just like **Max**. Little did I know, I fucked up on more occasions than Max has. It's pretty sad when you look at it.

I always want to stick it up to someone else, like **Chloe**. I want to be outgoing, fuck around and not care about things. I also, sometimes, over-react to things, just how Chloe has overreacted to some things during my first play-through. 

I want to protect everyone and make sure everyone is safe, like **David**, but I fail, and in the end, I don't end up protecting anyone. I only make things worse with my attitude and such strong will to change things how **I** think they should be.

I've been in the gutter, just like **Kate**, but thankfully, I've made it out of the ever-spiraling Hell of bullying and being picked on at school. I've toughened up, and I'm a stronger person now, but it still took a HUGE toll on me. In my play-through, Kate didn't make it. I wish she did, though.
I really do.

And last of the characters I'm going to do (I relate to more, but I really don't think I should be stretching it too much;) I relate to **Victoria**, because, I too, have done shitty things, that have pushed good people to do really shitty things, and I also feel awful, because I've mistreated some good people in my life. Same as Victoria Chase.

Fuck, guys. This game hit me so hard. I've basically had a great friendship going on, much like Max and Chloe have. I mean, if you can call that great? It's great to me, but maybe I'm just an underachiever. I don't know. I love the plot, I genuinely fell in love with it and how the game played out. The only other DONTNOD game that I've played was Remember Me, but I have to say - it hasn't garnered as much interest as Life is Strange, so I dropped that early on because I've felt the mechanics were a bit clunky. 

This game teaches you, that a single grain of sand can cause such a big mess. The butterfly effect. I mean, just think about it. It's the little things that change everything, every action has a reaction. You're probably reading this and going; "Oh, what the Hell is this person yapping about, we know!" - but I'm so *dazzled* by this masterpiece that I HAD to take it to Reddit.

Especially after I've gotten a response from the official Life is Strange Facebook page. I've contacted them to thank them for the game and it's everlasting beauty, and how simply GREAT it is. I told them that it inspired me to re-establish ties with the friend I've lost. And, this is the response I've gotten from them. It's not automated, so it made me very, very happy and it filled me with determination and hope.

I will do it. I will make things right. This is their response;

"Thank you so much for the support ---! We love hearing from our passionate fans and we can't thank you enough for playing the game and sharing your thoughts about it with us here! We're so happy to hear that Life is Strange managed to affect you in such a manner and that you'll now hopefully reconnect with a friend of old. All the best and good luck!"

Seriously, like - I'm already recommending this game to all my friends, as it's not just a game. It's;
a) A work of art. An amazing one.
b) A **very** valuable lesson that everyone could use once in a lifetime.
c) Other great things that are not a) or b).

The soundtrack is great. It got me hooked, it brought out the tears. The most emotional moments were the shots of Max sitting alone by that tree in the junkyard. It was so beautiful, yet so sad and... I don't know. It feels surreal, because I often see myself like that. Just sitting and contemplating things. Admittedly, I do this in the local park.

But what I've been trying to say for the past 3500 words is; I love this game, everything it portrays, how it's laid out and how the plot develops and how the characters all are... human, after all.

I felt really bad for Nathan when I found out he's dead, and also when I've heard the message he's sent to Max. I hated the guy the whole game, but I couldn't help but feel bad. In the Diner, I just wanted to hug Frank and apologize for sending Pompidou out on the street. (Yes, I did that. &gt;_&gt;) I felt devastated and torn when I told him about Rachel Amber, and when he told me how he was only jealous of Chloe... my heart nearly stopped, seriously. It's the little things that you didn't expect from people. I'm also glad I haven't warned Victoria, because she didn't seem to be in the Dark Room, which is good. I just, honestly, wish Victoria wasn't such a straight-up bully, and that she was more compassionate through the game.

But anyways. I guess there's good in all people, no matter how bad they actually are. Even Mark Jefferson, and even Nathan Prescott.

tl;dr
-I skipped through some plot in this wall of text, but it's still spoiler-heavy and it's my experience with LiS.
-At first I thought it was one of those over-hyped games, but I proved myself wrong.
-Emotional roller-coaster.
-I cried a lot. I never really cry.
-I only wanted to help. I only messed up.
-I relate to basically everyone.
-Kill me, I feel depressed after playing this game, and I value things I've lost even more.
-I'm a big softie with a hard outer shell ;-;
-In love with LiS now, what do?
-I probably bored you if you've read this far. ;-;

What do you think of a crossover? Like maybe Max finds Yarny and Yarny helps her, or something. I've only gotten as far as the idea of Max finding Yarny. As far as a story goes, I don't have anything. Yarny deals with memories, Max deals with going back in time. I feel like something could be done with this as far as the two meeting.

I am playing through again for the first time, and when in the diner before you spill the beans with Frank there is an interview on the tv. 

The interviewer makes mention of a similar snow storm one hundred years in the past, which got me thinking about season 2.

In my head I can't see anyway to continue the story with new characters without it seeming cheap, but what if instead of a new story with a different Max they were to get into the history of Arcadia Bay and the strange things going on there?

If there weren't subtle references to Twin Peaks I would have never thought of it, but there are. In that story, as you probably are aware, there are a lot of references to the place the story is being told, almost making it to be the most mythical and mysterious character in the series. 

What if instead of trying to create a new story set in contemporary times, they instead went into some of the history of the place?

Maybe one hundred years ago there was a similar situation in Arcadia bay? Perhaps they get into the place itself, and the mythology of it?

Just a thought, but I think it would be neat.
/////////////////////
My friend has never played life is strange, but he's watched most of a let's play and knows the story decently. I told him I was replaying it, and at first I told him it was because I was completing the photo album collectibles. 

But now, I've finished the collectibles and now just replay it to feel really good, and even get emotional at the different parts of the stories. It's really peaceful and relaxing. I don't know how to explain it.

Do you guys replay this game? How would you explain to someone why this narrative game is worth replaying multiple times?
/////////////////////
One of the first photos you have the option of taking is the one of the "RACHEL AMBER FOREVER" or something of the sort etched into the table in Jefferson's classroom. 

On my first playthrough I was exploring the menu and noticed that one of the optional photos in ep5 was the exact same thing except it said "CHLOE PRICE FOREVER". 

For the longest time I was convinced that they would alter something in the past and Chloe would end up being the one missing/dead. Could have made for an interesting alternate storyline or ending.
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back! Today, we shall have a discussion about:

If in the morning you'd wake up in Arcadia Bay, what would you do?
/////////////////////
What songs weren't in the game, but totally could have been?  I thought [Edit the Sad Parts by Modest Mouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49Gz0Jfp-jI) would have been a nice addition.  Come to think of it, I'm a little surprised there was no early Modest Mouse in this game since they nail that poignant PNW vibe pretty well in their first couple albums.
/////////////////////
I have no idea what to expect, but I'm still in shock from the end of episode 3. You can say, I'm a wee bit nervous. 
/////////////////////
So, I've finished playing Life is Strange and I discussed some things with a friend of mine that watched a playthrough. Nevermind the emotional trauma we've both ended up with, I noticed something very peculiar about the whole deal.

To cut it short, I believe I can prove that Max's power was no mistake and that she actually got it FROM someone else and that the most probable person to give Max the power is... **Nathan Prescott himself.**

I have reasons to believe that this power to rewind time is something that has been passed along in the Prescott family throughout the generations and as such, Nathan is supposed to be the last one to have it, but somewhere, something goes wrong. So, let's check the facts!

Some digging into the Prescott family reveals that it's quite old, as you can find a letter from 1901, if I remember correctly, in the barn that contains the Dark Room, in which a Prescott demands a loan to be paid back. It is never explained how a rich family can... stay rich in a small town on the West Coast of USA. Well, the explanation would be that the Prescotts got rich because they had an unfair advantage.

Second, Nathan is deranged for some reason. One could hold his father responsible for all the stress, or the fact that he's a criminal might also take its toll on him, BUT information about Nathan is strange: first of all, in his school file, his age is slightly off than in another mentioning of this (citation needed, the original 'bug' I saw on this was on Tumblr and I can't find it anymore).

This is relevant because we know that a recurrent theme of time travel/time rewind is the difference in aging. If you reverse time, your age remains the same, while technically, the ages of everyone else is reversed. Add this a few times and you can make a difference of months and in enough time, even years. That explains the gap.
The wiki offers some amazing insight into Nathan's spirit animal, which could be the whale. It might sound far-fetched, but beached whales could symbolize the loss of Nathan's power, which was his element, just as water would be the whales' element.

Now, onto the fun part

We have to establish three things.

* When did Nathan lose his power and why.
* What's his real connection to Max.
* What's his connection to Chloe and Rachel.

The game is pretty straightforward with the last two, stating that he hates Max for some reasons (along with Frank and Jefferson, who act as if they KNOW something about Max, which could actually be some intuition telling them that she has the said power). Therefore, the connection to Max is obvious and realized through his connection with Rachel, who was his love interest and whom Max impersonates at some point.

Now, why would Nathan, Frank and Jefferson act around Max as if she's different and special unless they would know something about the time-rewinding power? Nathan must have shown it to Frank and Jefferson in some way or another. In Jefferson's case, it would be obvious that it'd be related to their shady criminal activities. So, what about Frank? Rachel. Rachel could have rejected Nathan because he showed her the power and she found him despicable, then could've told Frank about it. It's just a theory, though!

Chloe found a track on Nathan the two got involved in the drug business, again, through Frank.

With that out of the way, let's get to the interesting bit. When did Nathan lose his power and why? What do we know about the timeline? Well, the storm is bound to hit Arcadia Bay on October the 15th. On the wiki, Rachel's death is presumed to be between April and October. Max came into Arcadia Bay some weeks before the events in Life is Strange.

Nathan was obsessed with Rachel, so maybe after he kidnapped Rachel to use her as a model, he kept her for a while, before overdosing her, hence the large time gap between the moment of her disappearance and the moment of her presumed death. This is even more evident due to the fact that Chloe grimaces because of the smell when she and Max discover Rachel's buried body; so Rachel, had, in fact, died quite recently. However, we are given several indications that Nathan regrets her death. So, if Nathan had rewind powers and could rewind to save Rachel, why didn't he?

**Because he couldn't.**

You see, the story of Life is Strange revolves around saving, or purging, a town that is so deeply depraved and degenerate that it needs an external factor (Max) capable of incredible empathy and dedication, who is innocent and at some points childish, but not naive. Whatever the heck gave the Prescott family the power, the same entity (which may or may not be represented by the storm) wanted Max to have it. What does this mean? That Nathan killed Rachel while Max already had his power and thus he couldn't use it to save Rachel after he overdosed her. So that means we know when and why Nathan lost his power.

Moreover, the moments in which Max cannot use her power are exactly the moments in which Nathan, through sheer force of will, tries to grab it back. This can be explained as follows. Nathan drugged Kate and used her as a model. He did not kill her and he released her afterwards, risking his own hide because he didn't want another Rachel on his conscience. When Kate attempts to suicide and Max cannot use her power, it might be because Nathan used it the night before so he could prevent Kate from dying. Also, maybe in that moment he is trying to use it so he can help Kate, out of pure guilt.

So, Rachel's death, having his sister disappear from his life, the passivity of a mother we know absolutely nothing about and a demanding, hateful father leave Nathan scarred and scared, pushing him into Jefferson's arms, who's a murderous psychopath. Nathan becomes a victim.

But wait, there's more! The wiki says that there've been theories going around that Nathan knows about the storm. Okay, while that might seem unlikely, I say that somehow, Nathan, Jefferson and David all know about the storm, in addition to Chloe and Max. Why? Because they store food.

The food in David's garage and the canned stuff in the Dark Room. You must be stupid to believe that Jefferson would give his models food. Being drugged means you don't exactly want to eat and he couldn't have kept his subjects for more than a few days. Also, Jefferson seems totally uncaring about the storm outside as he photographs Max, before she's saved by David. By that time, Nathan is dead. Frank is crushed in the Two Whales diner. Chloe is dead as well.

Max has to make the choice. Save the town or Chloe. Either way, the choice she makes is morally correct.
If she sacrifices Arcadia Bay, she acts like a judge regarding the case of a degenerate town. If she sacrifices Chloe, she is merciful towards all those people.

This theory simply says why Max got her power and tries to find a meaning in a few plot holes here and there. Let me know what you think and feel free to be as skeptical as you like! :D

Just finished ep2 last night and I noticed the fisherman had a open red folder on his table, the same that are cut to at the end of ep1 &amp; ep2. If this is the level of detail that builds up to the conclusion then I love it! what else have I missed? so many questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBX3SNYWfK0
/////////////////////
(Reposted for the spoiler tag)

That game played with my feelings better than any other game ever has. I finished the game around 2 in the morning. 10/10, the story was phenomenal. I chose for Chloe to live, but that doesn't really matter. The ending was literally just the trolley problem with a twist, and I love it. Personally, I wish that the ending to save the town would just make the tornado worse, killing everyone including yourself. That's what you get for saying that a human life is worth trading for something else. People are invaluable no matter what, you best-friend-murdering ass.

First of all, I killed a lot of people. I know it's not that kind of game, but Max's KDR is fucking fantastic. Just to name a few, I killed the teacher, Kate, the drug dealer, a trucker, and an old homeless woman. These are a just few of the people that I killed directly. I decided personally wether they would live or die. They had to die, of course, because Max is the god damn Princess of Persia, and they are just filthy casuals. What's the population of Arcadia bay again? It's zero, because Max was in town. She's kind of a badass.

I wish that it gave you the choice to literally just shoot somebody then go straight to a romance scene. It would be like a time traveling James Bond! Imagine if instead of going back and texting David about the teacher, Max just let Chloe die for a minute (for like the third time), takes the gun Nathan leaves, and shoots the teacher! Like, seriously. She passed up a great chance to be like Bruce Willis in Looper. I want to mod the game so that I can just shoot him, frame David, and then go have a great time at that party with Chloe. Like James Bond and Bruce Willis would do.

All jokes aside, the story was deeply touching and did something that very few games can make me do: it made me think, and it made me feel. The entire game felt like an effort to try and make life better by rewinding the clock for the most favorable outcome, but nothing really got better. It just changed to a new reality with it's own pros and cons. In the end, I saved Chloe's life. For how long? 50 years? 80? What's time to the girl who controls it? 

The characters were crafted beautifully, and I found myself emotionally invested in several of them. The voice acting was damn near perfect. I feel like every character depicted an archetype of an emotion meant to be easily relatable. Victoria was my favorite, although playing as her for a whopping 45 seconds felt gimmicky and unnecessary. There was nobody that wasn't fleshed out except for Max's parents, who are out of sight and out of mind. The texts were a wonderful touch.

Really, my only complaint is over the last chapter. I feel like it gave me too much closure, so much that it felt forced. All through the game, you could simply rewind and decide which outcome was the most favorable after any action or conversation. There comes a point to where I wanted to be denied that pleasure. I wanted to be left in the dark about a lot of it. 

Whenever I think about closure, I sometimes think of the big lebowski. It doesn't give you a happy or sad ending, it just ends. The Dude doesn't know everything, but he came out of it without losing everything. Closure is practically non-existent in that movie. That's what I wanted this game to be. I wanted it to just kind of... Stop. The last chapter felt extremely dialogue heavy, and kind of drug on. I told everybody about everything, and nobody was left in the dark by the time I left that reality for one where all of them die.
/////////////////////
Completed my second pass through the game last night (the Ep 4 party and all of Ep 5).  My goal for the play through was to try and form enough attachment to all the other characters to be able to bring myself to choose Bay.

I looked at everything, and used the rewind to get into everyone's business.  Used every "sit" spot to gather Max's thoughts and payed much closer attention to the journal.

I came to "understand" and even like way more of the supporting characters than on the first pass.  I didn't kiss Chloe, let her steal the handicapped fund (bad parking penalty!) or side with her against David in the argument.

During the nightmare I listened to all the people in the diner, thought about all the little Max and Chloe snippets.  

I did laugh when nightmare Jefferson says “Art is supposed to make you cry …”.

This time I paid really careful attention to every word of Chloe's final speech.  I genuinely believed she had grown enough to be prepared to sacrifice herself for her mother and others.

"Max Caulfield. Don't You Forget About Me" – Absolutely destroyed me.

When I could see again; I saved the Bay even though everything in me really didn’t want too (no matter how hard I had tried to prepare, it just wasn’t enough).

The bathroom scene is pure torture, and was either planned from the start or a very happy accident of writing.   Hearing Nathan say “No one will even miss your punk ass” while Max cries in the corner doing exactly that was unbearable.  I was just numb through the rest of the scene.

If I ever end up on a time travel adventure with my best friend, you should all leave town immediately!   


EDIT:
I don't believe this game has a "right" ending (I'm still totally Bae - but its pure emotion, there is no rational justification).  Its final choice is a no-win scenario where both outcomes support the message of "there is no perfect choice, do your best and then let it go".

Hey Reddit, just wondering if anyone knows (or can direct me to a guide) on how to change the buttons in game to PS3 buttons? I would find it more comfortable with the PS3 icons in the game. There is a mod for Metal Gear Solid V but not one for Life Is Strange.

Thanks
/////////////////////
Life is Strange is one of those games that just looks beautiful. The music is great, and you get nostalgic feelings (at least in the first 3 episodes). 
I just finished a game called Unravel. It has beautiful scenery, beautiful music, and it gives you nostalgic feelings. It isn't episodic, it's a puzzle game, and it's relatively short, but I feel like a lot of people who liked Life is Strange would probably enjoy Unravel. 
/////////////////////
Wow... I don't want to say I beat it because it doesn't feel like I won. Anything. At all. That game was one of the most fucked up, twisted and depressing game of all time. It was also one of the most immersive and best games I have ever played. I honestly don't think I will ever be the same again. I'm a grown ass man and at some points i was almost inconsolably distraught. I haven't cried in years, let alone from a vidjya game, but this game... wtf man. My girlfriend asked me what was wrong and i couldn't explain it! To anyone else who has finished the game, I think we all could use a hug .
On a lighter note, did anyone else notice the massive amount of easter eggs("thanks for crying", sci-fi, time travel, memes, etc.) in the game?

I got to the boys' dorm and checked out Nathan's room already. I went to the window to photograph the footprints but the prompt doesn't come up. Is this an odd bug or are you unable to take the picture after getting the evidence from Nathan's room? I tried reloading the checkpoint but I start leaving the room instead of going back to the beginning of the dorm section.

Hello,

I am wondering if you bought clothes from any website and if you're happy with the quality. 

I am looking for Chloe's top tank but it's very PRICEY (pun totally intended) especially on insertcoin, even redbubble ... And since only insertcoin is the "official" shop and I guess quality is better there right? 

I need your help. D:

Thank youuuu.
/////////////////////
Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents. Today, we shall have a topic about:

At what moment were you the most immersed in the game? Why?
/////////////////////
I've been following this game since Episode 1's launch, subbed the reddit a few days later.

I remember seeing all the theories, the feels, the response, and I was a part of it.

Now there's new people picking up the game, and they come on here sharing their experiences and feels. It just brings me back to all the nights I spent playing Life is Strange, reading the Reddit, watching playthroughs. It's kinda depressing, lol.
/////////////////////
I see a text on Max's tab dated 10/09 in which Warren says he got a B Minus in a chemistry test and Max texts back asking "I don't know. Who is this?".

Did I miss something? Does she not have Warren's number?
/////////////////////
I was discussing the Chloe sacrifice with someone and I thought it deserved input.

I just realized that the Chloe that died in the bathroom, along with not ever experiencing the week with Max, was also a Chloe that didn't want to die. The Chloe that lived made that choice. 

This is really an excuse to express my feelings. 

The thought of Max being alone with her situation is enough to leave me in a catatonic state, in existential sorrow. 

Anyone feel the same? 
/////////////////////
If anybody is interested in parting with their copy, PLEASE let me know! Willing to pay a fair amount for it.
/////////////////////
when will the crying stop
/////////////////////
The moment I fell in love with the game was in the first episode when Max plugged in her earbuds and the music started playing while you walk down the hallway.

What's your favorite moment?
/////////////////////
..sacrificing Acadia Bay by saving Chloe? Did I just kill Warren, Kate.. everyone?
/////////////////////
Holy shit. I've only finished episode 2, and what am I doing to myself? I figured Kate was going to try and kill herself at some point in the game early on in episode 1. I was tearing up just talking to her in her room, I don't think I could handle it if she died. Thankfully, I saved her anyway, but I looked ahead to make sure I was making the right choices. I had to save her, I might have just quit right there if she jumped. 

This is totally against how I play these games, I always try to go in completely blind. Even with the last decision of the episode I ended up reading other people's thoughts and spoiling a bit before I chose. You would think the ability to rewind would make choosing easier, but it doesn't. 

Should I quit now? The game has been amazing so far, but from reading a bit of this sub it seems like it's only the tip of the iceberg. If (when) I continue I'm definitely going to force myself to no look ahead anymore, I gotta be strong and let the emotional impact of the game feel more natural. I'm just afraid it's going to break me. 

I feel so weak lol.

Hi folks, 

I know this will be a little outdated at the moment, but we'd like to give this issue another nudge. Basically, some gamers playing on Xbox might have not been able unlock to Shutterbug Achievement due to a supposed bug. 

We *might* have managed to track down the issue to some incorrect metadata on Microsoft's Achievement backend, but unfortunately Microsoft requires concrete proof before taking any action. We discovered the possible cause of it a few months ago but so far Microsoft has not been able to gather enough data on it.

If you've encountered this issue, please visit [this link on Xbox live](http://xbx.lv/achsticky), scroll down the bottom of the page and click on 'Take our Survey'. With the information you provide there, Microsoft may hopefully be able to confirm the issue and resolve it on their side.
/////////////////////
I played my frist time using Xbox360.

Are there noticeable differences between the different platforms? I have noticed differences in graphics (obviously way better than 360 graphics), but is that it?

I have also debated how much I would have liked this game playing on a PC. I only have a Mac so I don't think I have the option anyway. But I always wondered if using a mouse/keypad would affect my emotions during the gameplay. 
/////////////////////
I can't get those strange, masochistic images of Max watching a verbally abusive Chloe going at it with everyone but her in some sort of spiteful, sex-fueled torture session. 

And the chilling offer from Jefferson to have Max live in his dark room, only for her to gleefully accept.

I want my psyche back.

I have dabbled in photography before, but the analysis and detail that it is explored has really made it stand out.

I am a sucker for visual metaphor and mood so this helped me realized that photography could be a good outlet.

Anyone else?
/////////////////////
Was browsing amazon to see if there's any art book (besides the LE, which I might end up buying) and found [this collection of poems](https://www.amazon.ca/Times-Have-Changed-Life-Strange/dp/1434398536). I wonder if the game storytellers were aware of this?
/////////////////////
I theorize that the Christian God was blocking Max's powers during the suicide scene in episode 2. 

Kate truly believes in the tenets of her religion, right? She believes so strongly that she's willing to commit suicide (a **huge** sin) and be damned rather than lie to herself about God's decrees (and/or claim, like more self-righteous Christians, that His judgment somehow does not apply to her). 


I think that God was- for admittedly, confusing reasons- trying to stop Max from devaluing Kate's belief. If Max had been capable of rewinding during that scene, even a little, she would have saved Kate- would have reversed events in Hell and on Earth. But such an action, however compassionate, would have interfered with God's...jurisdiction? He might prefer that Kate suffer after her (potential) death and believe in Him, believe her punishment was justified, rather than allow Max to go 'Nuh-uh, not happening' and invalidate Kate's freedom to decide where she 'should' go after death. Once Kate jumped off that roof, her soul was no longer subject to the human world- only God, *her* God. As she believed should happen, even up to the moment of her death. 


So God allowed free will to affect events during Kate's *life*, allowed Max to convince her to live. Freedom in life is a human thing, something everyone has. But when Max is like 'No, I decide what happens to her soul after death, not you and not Kate herself', God steps in to preserve the belief, the choices of His follower. Max can save Kate, just like any human could (try to, at least), but she can't do so supernaturally. She does not have the right to intervene in strictly Christian matters, as Kate's suicide became once/if it succeeded.


Chloe, on the other hand, isn't subject to any god- so Max can save her artificially, by rewinding. The only thing trying to *keep* Chloe dead is time itself (as personified by Arcadia's various *natural* disasters).
/////////////////////
This is something you discover really early in the game, if you rewind all the way to the beginning of the "time spiral", the edges of her vision go red and Max recoils, as if going back that far had a physical effect.

Any theories for why that is?
/////////////////////
So, after I installed the Japanese dub, I found that the controls became a bit... unusual (to me).

* A - Back
* B - Select

I guess the japanese version has different controls.

Of course, this is my fault, but how do I reverse this to my usual layout?

Hello and welcome back, guys and girls. Today, we shall have a topic about:

If Max and Chloe had swapped personalities, how different do you think the game would've been?
/////////////////////
[EP5 SPOILERS](#s I've just experienced one of the most intense connections to a video game that I  could have imagined.

I sacrificed Chloe. I was rewarded with a beautiful conclusion to a passionate, painful, desperate, loving, intimate relationship in turn.

The butterflies flying over the cliff was enough to make me basically burst into weeping, for a good ten minutes.

The ending song at the funeral was the icing on the cake.

The whole supertime reality distortion where Max is taliing to herself is extremely bizarre. More so, was the Jefferson photo scene. I felt personally violated. At the same time, I understood his morbid fascination with innocent model laying bare and vulnerable to capture. It was an interesting peek into his psyche. One that both evoked rage and empathy.

I felt my heart tear open at the realization of the inevitability and necessity in her death. I wanted to save her, I really don't want to believe it was a necessity.

I feel peaceful, though. Happy. Curious and gutted not have saved her but it's as if a weight has been lifted from me.

I'm usually a very obsessive person when it comes to pieces of art, especially video games. I can dwell and constantly research a piece for months but this game has got me like no other.

I do feel rather empty, though.  I'll be thinking about this for weeks.

I will probably make a more detailed analysis tomorrow. For now, I'm far too emotional.

Thank you for commenting on my journey. It has helped to post my feelings.

No Emoji, guys. No fucking Emoji.

/////////////////////
Sorry for the huge post. The **TL;DR is: I loved David, disliked Chloe, wish I had Principal Wells in my life, and thought saving the Bay was the perfect ending and saving Chloe shouldn't have even been an option.**

I just recently played and finished LiS for the first time and absolutely loved it. It was a great story, with great storytelling, and I'm hooked. And of course what's the first thing you do when you finish a new game/show/book? Go online and discuss it with other people. Or when I'm behind on something, I'll just read through the discussions that others had, like the episode release threads in this sub, or end-of-year discussions on /r/games, etc.

What caught me by surprise was how everyone else seemed to receive the game. The overwhelming number of people that chose to save Chloe. The even bigger number of people who loved everything except the ending - some very strongly. The number of people that didn't appreciate the story that was being told, instead disliking it because it wasn't the story they thought it would be or wanted to be told or (in my opinion) they didn't get it, thus thought the ending was weak.

I feel like I need to provide a contrary opinion, even if almost no one is reading this sub anymore.

-----------

Let me start with **David** because I think how I felt toward him directly influenced how I felt toward Chloe, and everything else by extension. There are exactly two moments (that I remember) that I disliked what David was doing, but everything else made him a great guy.

Right from the start it seems like the game is trying to make you dislike him (and I'm sure many did) because you meet him and he's rather aggressive and accusatory. I literally had no negative reaction to this encounter, in fact I kinda respected the guy who had found the prankster so quickly. Regardless of what we know happened in that bathroom, all David knows is that someone pulled a fire alarm, most students are already outside, and here comes someone out of the bathroom acting with no haste and already behind everyone else. Either they pulled the alarm as a prank, or they're doing something nefarious in the bathroom, like drugs. Either way, they're up to something and it's literally his job to find out what.

That said, at the time I was also trying to figure out the flow of this game and which characters were important to focus on and learn about, so I wrote him off as an observant guard who's good at his job and *might be* someone I have to outsmart in later parts of the story.

Outside, I learn from Ms Grant that David's trying to get the school hooked up with an array of security cameras, but apparently that's a bad thing? I literally just saw a girl get shot in the bathroom by a kid who's too powerful to reprimand without solid evidence, and there's posters everywhere for some other missing girl. Why the hell would I sign that petition? Another +1 for David; this guy has his head on straight.

The last time we see him before meeting Chloe is when he's "harrassing" Kate. This is one of my two moments where I didn't really like what he was doing, but it was more his method of talking to her, not that he was trying to get answers. I don't really know anything about this Kate character and I've already seen that this David guy has good instincts about security, so either she's a suspect in something, thus setting up this Kate character as a sleeper or red herring antagonist, or she's a victim of something and is hiding the details to protect her abuser, thus David is trying to help her. Regardless, he's going about it wrong, so let's get him off Kate's back and I'll figure it out myself as a peer. Another +1 for David being a good guy looking out for the school.

Cue **Chloe**. She's some wannabe punk that, upon reuiniting with her childhood best friend is instantly aggressive that they didn't keep in touch. Yes, it sucks, but that's how life is. Max made five new friends on the first day at this new school and you couldn't make more than one in five years in the place you grew up?

Fast forward, we find out she's a hellraiser who got expelled, gets high whenever she's home, and is already trying to manipulate/guilt trip me. Don't get me wrong, she's a tragic character, and very important to Max's growth through the story (which I'll get to), but certainly not instantly likeable. Then I find out she hates her stepdad and it shows. She finds wrong in literally everything he does and uses that to hate him more. Max discovers his security array in the house and that means he's a paranoid creep? First off, there were no cameras in the bathrooms, or even in Chloe's room. Second, what's wrong with having a home security system, especially in 2013? They're relatively cheap, especially if you can install it yourself, and it protects your home. Another +1 for David, and -1 for Chloe for freaking out about it. It wasn't exactly secret because Max found the monitor in an unlocked cabinet in the garage in about 5 minutes, and in retrospect it's never implied that Joyce didn't know. Chloe just refuses to talk to David nicely, so I can't imagine a time he could have mentioned it, and she's too lazy to leave her room and look around her own house from time to time.

The second instance of David doing wrong is when he slapped Chloe. No, people shouldn't be hitting each other. That said, she was constantly aggresive, flounting his house rules, and egging him on. The weed, seriously? I got nothing against the drug itself, but you know he doesn't like it or you having it, so what do you do? Smoke it in your car or the backyard? No, you smoke it *inside the house* and leave it laying out on your desk. That goes from disobeying to flaunting.

Moving on. Later in the series, after the night at the pool, Max has breakfast downstairs with Joyce and it's lovely. Chloe comes down and *immediatly* starts laying into her mother. God, the pain in Joyce's voice and face was heartbreaking. This girl needs to grow the fuck up. Then David comes home, we know damn well we're in the wrong breaking in, David probably knows it too, yet he still tries to be civil until Chloe lays into him too. Did I defend David? You're damn right I did. Chloe needs to grow up. A few scenes later, when I'm investigating the garage again, there's a message from David to the chief of police claiming that Chloe was with him the whole night and thus isn't a suspect in the pool break-in. By this point, the game is trying to turn David into a likeable character, assuming you started out hating him, but all it did was turn him from a respectable guy into someone to be admired. He really is trying to do right by his family and with his life.

And Chloe can't stand that.

**So onto the ending.** Every good story has a lesson, even if it's not stated. People have taken things like Dragonball Z and gleaned all kinds of great life lessons from it. LiS is no different. A lot of people disliked how your choices didn't seem to influence the ending, and I don't get that. When I watch a movie, or read a book, I don't get any influence on the story whatsoever. Here I got some influence on how events played out, but if you choose to save the Bay, then it quite literally didn't matter. Or did it? That's where you have to ask what the lesson of the story is.

The way I see it, the lesson is that you cannot build a perfect world. There are some things that it doesn't matter how many times you try, it's just not meant to be. Max tried to save William, and that led to her best friend asking for assisted suicide. She tried to stop Jefferson by texting David and winning the contest, and that led to the town being destroyed without her there to protect Chloe because Max is in San Fransisco. Then she tried to stop herself from winning the contest, but that just led her back into Jefferson's cave, but now he burned her things before she could travel back in time to text David to stop him.

And the biggest one, imo, is one they didn't spell out. I'm of the opinion that if Max had never recieved this power, here's how things would play out. Chloe would die in the bathroom. Max is a witness, so Nathan can't avoid arrest. Nathan's unstable and confesses, taking Jefferson down with him, thus Kate never commits suicide, Nathan doesn't get killed, Jefferson never kidnaps Max and Victoria, and the world moves on. Alternatively, Nathan doesn't spill the beans on Jefferson, but now Jefferson doesn't have access to the money needed to purchase drugs for his subjects, thus halting the kidnapping operation anyway, though Jefferson doesn't get caught.

By trying to save Chloe, Max sets off a chain of other unpleasant events and deaths that could have been completely avoided, nevermind the tornado. And even by saving Chloe once, Chloe keeps getting put in danger over and over again, Max having to save her from a train, Frank (twice), and Jefferson in the junkyard.

Ultimately, you have to accept that life is a strange tangled web and you can't have it all your way. Sometimes you have to let go and do the best you can with the way things are; a lesson, by the way, that Chloe never learned after William's death.

Chloe was a tragic character, and it's possible that with more time Max could have been a good influence on her and helped her straighten out. But life is a bitch and killed Chloe in the bathroom before Max got the chance. That's just how life goes sometimes and we all learn to live with it. The lesson is that even time travel can't change the fact that this is something we all have to learn.

People weren't satisfied with the save Chloe ending? Good. That ending makes for a pretty shitty overall story and destroys Max's character growth. I'm actually kinda torn on whether it should have even been an option. On the one hand, the authors need to tell the story they came to tell, and if that means everyone loses Chloe, then so be it. We all had to lose Dumbledore as well.

On the other hand, actually having to *make the choice* as the player to sacrifice Chloe made that choice so much heavier. I chose to do it, but dear god it was painful. As it should be. It's a painful choice for Max, and having the option there instantly extended all of the weight onto the player. So I'm torn on the issue, but not torn on what the proper ending of the story is.

-----

On a non-controversial note, I wanna gush about **Principal Wells** for a moment. Looking back on the story, he really does well as a principal. At first he comes across as a corrupt administrator who doesn't want to piss off a wealthy donor by getting Nathan in trouble, and that may be partially true, but as you get more info you realize it's not just about the money to the school. It's this donor in particular. The Prescotts own half the town, almost literally with their land rights, and people are always talking about how they've bought the police department. Wells wasn't just trying to protect the school's cash, he was probably trying to protect himself and Max from the wrath of Sean Prescott who could probably make their lives hell.

In spite of that, after Kate's events in episode 2, he was still willing to suspend Nathan when the evidence piled up. That tells me it *was* about avoiding Sean's wrath, and not about the cash, otherwise he probably would have still swept it under the rug. With enough solid evidence and some police support, he could safely take that risk. He's not necessarily corrupt, he just knows how to play the game.

What made me love him, however, was what he said to Max at the art gallery in San Fransisco. That was a *very* powerful and inspirational pep talk he gave her. It brought me to tears.

&gt;"San Francisco is so cool... and this gallery is huge."

*"So is the buffet. If an event skimps on the food, you know it's a bad event."*

&gt;"As long as I don't have to eat any caviar..."

*"This is your day, Max. You can do whatever you want. I hope you take advantage of your status and talk to as many influential people here as possible. Work the room."*

&gt;"I don't know... I feel so weird, like I'm a little kid hanging with the adults."

*"Max, after this week you are certainly not a little kid anymore. In fact, you're a noteworthy adult being honored by your peers. Now you have to start acting like the photographer you want to be. Hell, I wanted to be in charge of a big school someday, so I started taking charge of things when I was young. Ask my poor classmates...*

*"Max, I'm going to eat up that caviar so you don't have to. Better get in there and start schmoozing. You know, I won't always be here to take charge. But you come talk to me whenever you want."*

Idk, maybe it was the delivery. The way he stressed 'peers' was such a self-esteem booster. Even though it had no real effect on the greater story, I loved the art gallery and Principal Wells. I wish there'd been a great mentor like that at my school growing up.
/////////////////////
I do feel like i could have done more, so i think I will have to play through ep1 again after completing all 5

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23IBZ0HQoF8
/////////////////////
So, like just about everyone here, I got pretty messed up after playing Ep. 5 last October. And last October was already hard on me because my mom passed away 2 weeks before that final episode came out. I don't regret playing *Life is Strange* or finishing either ending, but I haven't picked it up since then. I love the characters and their stories, but compared to something like *Tales from the Borderlands*, I don't feel the urge to replay it from start to finish.

Has this been the case for anyone else? Or do you find a little time gone by helps the game's replay value?
/////////////////////
So I started playing episode 2 like 12 or so hours ago, and I just kept on chugging till I finished the game about fifteen minutes ago. Holy shit. I have some questions about the game, but also just wanna talk about it. It's a bummer coming to the party almost a year late but still, better late than never. obviously, SPOILERS AHEAD. 

So did anyone else get totally faked out by SAM? everyone was fooled by the Jefferson twist, but for the first two episodes, you're finding girly magazines and scarves in the maintenance shed and Sam is saying crazy shit nonstop. I didn't have enough respect for the writers in those first two episodes to think they weren't just too heavy-handed with their foreshadowing (like some of the dialoge). I didn't have faith in the writers and they absolutely fucked my shit up.

Questions about some payoffs:
So I drowned Lisa sadly. Does not drowning her have some sort of payoff? The same goes for saving Alyssa all 5 times. Does that payoff other than her living/dying?

More questions to come but I need to sleep im exhausted.
/////////////////////
I will put the question alongside the number and then my answer directly below each question. If I get enough responses I will probably post a summary of the answers in another thread in a few days. (Any interesting ideas may get mentioned too.)


Q1. Do you want a DLC before Season Two?

I personally would really like a DLC before Season 2 as it would feel appropriate with timings and a fitting final conclusion to the game. 


Q2. Do you think DONTNOD are already in the works of making a DLC.

From all the things they've said recently I suspect strongly that they are working on a DLC. Along with the fact that some of the Games Designers from Square Enix are still working on Life Is Strange even though it has 'supposedly finished'.


Q3. What would you like the DLC to be about? Rachel, One of the Maxs left behind(E.g after ending/not ending Chloe's Suffering), A post-episode 5 episode (socialising with people from your ending - Eg if Chloe has been sacrificed you could 'Go Ape' and Have Tea with Kate and after Sacrifice Arcadia ending you could see if anyone else survived and head down to Max's house in Seattle) or even another interesting idea I haven't mentioned. 

I would like any of these as a DLC but I think I would like the Rachel one the least as it would probably ruin Rachel's mystery for me. I think I like the idea of a DLC about one of the Max's who were left behind (oh god not another emotional game with a left behind DLC) the most. I would love to see how the Max reacted waking up to a Chloe who she supposedly put to rest by her in my game and seeing everyone's reactions to what Max did. It would also be interesting to fit in with the Vortex, Nathan, etc.


Q4. When do you think it would release if it were to happen?

I think we'd get it in May (or at least I'd like it then), because it would seem an appropriate amount of time for them to have been working on it since Christmas. Whilst also giving them room to prepare for season two. 


Q5. Would you like Season One and the DLC to have an influence on Season Two?

I don't really mind this but would prefer it if they did have some relevance to each other.


Q6. What do you want Season Two to be about (New Cast, New Power, etc) and When do you expect a release of Season Two?

I would like this to be about a new cast but probably with the same power. That way we could figure out how they got the power. I would also like our protagonist to really try to figure out their power along with us (maybe over a longer period) - like testing the strengths, weaknesses, etc. Also, I think a release of season Two Episode One will happen late January 2017 as it would match up to Season One in timings and the rumours seem to be heading for that date.


Thank you for reading and, hopefully, answering. I will make a summary if/when enough people answer and would like to share it when I get round to it. I think everyone of us would appreciate to know these community opinions and ideas.
/////////////////////
[EP4 SPOILERS] (#s "I don't know what to say.

First off, I assisted Chloe's suicide. It was tragically poignant. That left me emotionally weary.

I let Chloe kill frank. I want him out of Chloe's problems, even if it means picking up Chloe's psychological pieces.

Then, Jesus Christ. Nathan's room... Absolutely horrifying. I feel so goddamn guilty for letting it drive Kate to suicide.

I felt devastated for Chloe, too. Her numb response to the two moons, "The world is ending. I don't give a shit," was heartbreaking. 

Then, the ending. She was fucking shot. Jesus I hope I can save her. I would do anything to save her. 

By fucking Jefferson? THAT IS WHY NATHAN IS SO RAGING? HE IS BEING CONTROLLED BY JEFFERSON?

I feel numb. I don't want to go on living if Chloe is dead. ")
/////////////////////
Not talking about history, which I simply love with all my heart, but the gameplay specially the lack of difficulty through the game. I find the game overall way too easy for my taste, even where it shouldn't be.

Regarding Max successfully rescuing Kate from the rooftop... it was piece of cake. I thought it would be harder without the rewinding powers and all, but if you were paying attention, you know where to target to get her into safety.Chloe's and Max's wall of clues? Booooooooringly easy. You know almost everything about the case so it's just connecting the dots.Even Max's Nightmare should be a bit more challenging than it is. Sure it takes a bit of trial and error, but in the end it's not that hard.

I miss more puzzles, more thinking game, a bit more of Broken Sword-like nearly impossible clue finding. I hope that, if there's a second season, DONTNOD would think about more practical gameplay.

/////////////////////
So, I played this over the weekend and have been thinking about it ever since I finished. I had a thought on perspective that made me change how I viewed the game completely.  
  
First of all, I chose the Bay ending. Which, when it plays out undoes everything you've done the entire game as Max. I thought it was an interesting choice by the game developers. Which made me think this entire game is just one girl dealing with her guilt and grief.  
  
So, take Max - a shy, quiet girl who moves back to her former home town so she can follow her dreams and learn from the professor she loves. However, when she gets there she is miserable. She has only one real friend, one real class she enjoys, and is constantly bullied. She is frayed and battered and when she is trying to pull herself together she witnesses a girl getting shot in the bathroom.  
  
At this point she finds out that the girl is her former best friend from childhood who she had grown apart from. She is filled with grief and guilt. This sets off a series of dominos that results in her favorite teacher turning into a nightmare. She starts to think "what if..." as many of us do - the what if we did something different? What if we could turn back time and try again? She starts to indulge this fantasy. Eases her guilt by imagining a rebuilt friendship with Chloe. She gets to be the hero.  
But now, new guilt. Nathan and Mark Jefferson would still be out there not facing justice. Kate is depressed (scratches out the justice quote in her bible). She has to fix it to keep Chloe alive. Always keeping Chloe alive. Over and over.  
  
Finally at the end, make a choice. Accept the fact that this happened. That you are powerless. That life is cruel at times. Face your grief and move forward with your life. Or, destroy your reality. Cut off everyone you know in your life and retreat into your fantasy.  
  
People who experience trauma and shock like this sometimes are unable to deal with it and become catatonic. It's even more depressing to think about it this way, and I know people who chose the save Chloe ending will most likely disagree - but there it is.

I am a 24 year old male. I picked up Life Is Strange on a PlayStation sale last week for $10. Let me just say this is the best 10 dollars I have ever spent on any piece of "entertainment" if you want to even call it that. I am trying to put my feelings into words but I can't exactly explain the void this game has created in me. This has made me question all of my own life decisions.

I played an episode a day from when I purchased it. It instantly caught my attention from the deep characters and beautiful environment. Each day I became more attached to the game. By the end of Episode 3 I was already in tears. It really scared me how emotionally attached I had gotten to this game. I mean what kind of game is this? 

I never had a lot of friends in school and I really related to Max's situation. I really have never had a best friend like Chloe. I do have a lot of family that I am close to but no one like her. I became so close to these characters. They strangely feel like my friends. I also am rarely emotional about things like sad movies and such. I think this game opened a bottle of emotions that I didn't even know I had. As it turns out that bottle was pretty full!

The deepest part of the game to me was the nightmare sequence in episode 5. I can't get the images out of my head. Especially the part when Chloe was getting it on with pretty much every other character calling Max a baby and everything. 

In the end I had to save Chloe and didn't really watch the other ending until yesterday. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. I literally cried for 20 minutes after watching it. I can't imagine having to go through that. Being so helpless and Chloe not getting to have fun that week with us. Devastating.

One thing that that oddly comforted me was that Max smiles in both endings like everything is Ok. She truly is a very powerful person. I want to try to become more like her and make a difference. This game has really changed me.

I will never forget Arcadia Bay. Finding this subreddit has really made this easier to go through. Thanks for being here guys!
/////////////////////
I just finished Life is Strange for the second time now. I wanted to share my thoughts on this wonderful piece of art. Just to give you some context: 27yo European dude, who didn't know anything about LiS until two weeks ago.


The game's atmosphere caught me and never released me since. It's really not that usual for me. If I see a really great movie, I might be thinking about it for one or two days. If I play a really great game I'll enjoy it for the moment, but as soon as it finishes I'll just continue with my life and stuff. But ever since LiS ended I feel some emptiness. And this is a good thing, because it means LiS really got me, which is the main purpose of art after all. I wake up thinking about Arcadia Bay stuff, go to work and actually work while listening to the OST, and go to sleep watching videos about LiS. It's sick. This kind of emotional bond with a fictitious world happens rarely with me. Even if these feelings were to vanish tomorrow I'd still be very grateful to the creators for letting me experience this story.


**So what makes LiS so exceptional?** It triggers emotions in you, makes you think about your life. I think one of the key elements in this is that it lets you live in its world. You spend most of your time getting to know the characters and talk to them: the slow paced and character oriented gameplay really helps to create a bond between you and the world of Arcadia. And OFC it does this by having an astonishing soundtrack, a touching story with many great characters, unique hand-drawn visuals and fun gameplay mechanics built around a very specific concept. 
That concept being time traveling right? At first sight the main premise of the game seems to be time traveling. Sure, it's fun to be able undo some dialogues and do them again giving different answers, it gives a nice little twist to the well known dialogue based gameplay. However, what I think is that LiS is not a sci-fi about a teenage girl who magically gained the power of time traveling. It just wouldn't make much sense and the game also makes it perfectly clear that it won't even bother to explain the rules of time traveling, nor the causes, consequences or basically nothing in that regard. It never goes into scientific details and it's all good, because it shouldn't - and neither should we - since that's not an important aspect of the story at all.


Life is Strange is a coming of age story: all the shit that goes down is about youth and becoming an adult. Time traveling serves as a metaphor to your youngling years where you can try out many different things, without having to fear the consequences of your decisions. You can make everything right: just like Max, you're in a safe bubble, no responsibilities attached. However as time goes on, you will grow older and soon you will have to face decisions that will have serious effects. And those are the decisions that will transform you from being a child to being an adult. This is another key feature of the story that makes so many of us feel strongly connected to game's world. To be young is something we all experienced, and leaving the teen ages behind ourselves is another experience that most of us can easily relate to.


**Life is Strange is about Max entering adulthood.** There is a strong notion across all the episodes that Max is a person who constantly tries to fix everything. Optimism and naivety of a child. But sooner or later everyone will reach a point where a choice has to be made where you won't be entirely happy with the outcome - that's just how life works. 

You choose a nice career - you crush your dreams of becoming an artist. 
Your family is strongly against it, but you move to another country - making you happy and making them disappointed. 
The point Max reaches adulthood is at the light tower in EP5, not surprisingly at the final decision where she has to choose between Chloe and Arcadia Bay.

One thing to note about LiS that this story doesn't have to do anything with the universe targeting a teenage girl (Chloe) for termination. The storm doesn't make Max a mass murderer either, it only represents the unavoidable downside of hard decisions. I'm writing this because I saw some people taking the time travel aspect of the story in a literal way. When reading their comments I'm always like come on, are you cereal? Going through that door would lead to dozens and dozens of continuity errors. 

If you're wondering about these questions you might be looking LiS from the wrong side:

- How did Max gain this power? How's time travel possible without any device?

- Why have this power stopped working when trying to save Kate? (And then come back all of a sudden?)

- Why did a storm appeared out of nowhere triggered by messing with timelines? (Not talking about the snow, birds, whales etc.)

- Does rewinding or traveling through photos create alternate timelines or Max just modifies the current timeline? (BTW it's the latter, but still not important at all.)

- etc.


But then there would be even more serious moral issues if we took time traveling as it is:

- If alternate timeline Chloe's father was clearly alright after all these years that would mean there is no predestination in LiS rules of time traveling. (If someone originally died he/she hasn't have to die in another timeline like in some movies.) In that case why hasn't Max tried other scenarios to save them both? Eg. saving his father, then go back again a bit later to save Chloe from the car crash.

- Max leaving Chloe alive, thus getting a town destroyed makes her a mass murderer? (I'll forget the fact that the game never told us how many citizens were actually sacrificed. It has been clearly left ambiguous by the developers.) Why didn't she travel back in time to save people from more severe natural disasters or help them getting rid of actual mass murderer dictators? Even if she can only travel back to places in her own life (and cannot go back for example to stop Hitler) it's easy to see there would be an infinite number of ways for her to make the world a better place. Like winning on the lottery a huge ass money and spend it on starving children, build houses for the poor etc. If we were to take time travel seriously - and again, we shouldn't - Max would be the most selfish person in the world in both endings.

- I might be wrong, but I don't remember a single word regarding her powers after the final decision. If she still has the power, than that big final decision is not really a decision at all. I can clearly imagine a scenario, where Max would choose Chloe over Arcadia Bay, then they would live a happy life together or something. At age 80 they say goodbye to each other, Max comes back to the school bathroom and only then let her die. I mean, she has enough selfies to go back anywhere in her life. The same goes for the other ending, where you dramatically say goodbye to her, attend her funeral etc.. Still having the opportunity to go back any time to hang out with her again. It just wouldn't make any sense and it would take away the weight of the whole story.

I could continue with these but I'm just gonna stop here. My point is that these questions aren't issues at all: time travel related stuff should be handled as symbolism story-wise and as fun regarding the gameplay.

*Just a quick side note: With all that being said, the sacrifice Chloe ending was one of the most heartbreaking scenes I ever saw in a fictitious story. I only witnessed it on let's play videos so far and I'm not sure I'd ever be able to choose that one by myself. It's plain horror and IMHO could be a great way to torture people's emotions. The strange thing about this is that I wasn't even affected mostly by the fate of Chloe, but by Max's. Poor girl put all her efforts into saving her bff/love just to witness her dying again and to make it worse all of their adventures, memories and relationship became nothing but just a fiction in her head. This might even be considered cruelty.*


**Anyway, let me get back to my train of thought about LiS being a coming of age story:**

Max's noose bleeding means she's getting tired of trying fixing everything. 

She faints sometimes because she's getting REALLY tired of this. 

At Kate's suicidal attempt she first learns that there might stuff that can't be fixed even by her.

At the final light tower scene in EP5 she realizes that in order to continue with her life she has to make a tough decision and in either scenario take the responsibilities for her actions. In her case it was choosing who she cared the most: her best friend/lover or her acquaintances.

She lives on with the consequences and not trying to fix everything anymore.

She learned how to let go of the past.

Super Max became Adult Max.



*And for me: now I hella want to visit Oregon on a sunny day while listening the greatest game soundtrack that the universe has ever known. :)*
/////////////////////
Wow. So I just finished the game in about a week, and that was too much to handle. It was the most emotional and heart-wrenching game I have played yet. Although I chose Bae &gt; Bay, the reality of what I just did, has hit me hard. This was a crazy experience that will be with me forever. The part I was most troubled by was the voice to kill chloe or let her die slowly. That part really struck home for me. The game became all to real at that point. And because I chose to kill chloe in the other timeline, I had to save her in the regular one. I would like to know how many people chose to kill Chloe in the other timeline or let her live. It has been troubling me for the entire day, feedback would be awesome
/////////////////////
[EP3 SPOILERS](#s " I hate you all for gleefully anticipating the death of my innocence.

I knew that something was going to be wrong with Chloe. I think most did. 

I enjoyed the pool antics and the shiptease. I knew there had to be a catch.

I can feel a tragedy around every corner. ")
/////////////////////
I don't know what to say. This game was one of the best I've ever played. I've finished about 5 days ago and still think about it. The whole game was awesome and it left me with unforgetable memories. It made me cry. I'm still thinking about it every day and I don't think I'll stop soon. But I wish I could erase my memories and play it all again. Please tell me I'm not the only one like this.
/////////////////////
So as the title states, just finished the game on Friday. Everyone here should already see this coming, but out of the hundreds of games I've played, nothing ever came close to fucking up my real life as much as this one did. Its been years since I've actually cried, I almost forgot that I could. I've been in this weird funk since I finished. I wouldn't exactly call it depression, but god damn does it feel similar. This mainly has to do with the fact that unlike a lot of the users in this sub, I chose Bay&gt;Bae, only because personally I couldn't see myself, or Max for that matter, sacrificing so many people for my/her own happiness. I guess its just the way I interpreted Max as a character. Yes, her and Chloe were in love in my game, and I got my kiss at the end there, but everything in the story made me think that Max was logical enough to look at the big picture and see that yes she was doing all she could to save Chloe, but all it kept leading to was more problems. And there is only one way to make sure her life goes back to normal, which she wishes for multiple times in the game, and that was to sacrifice Chloe and move on. And when you go back and try to save William and end up fucking up the future, I saw that as clear sign that things need to happen the way theyre supposed to happen, and her continuous messing with the timelines was only going to cause more trouble than good. So, I sacrificed Chloe and put an end to all of it. Its so intensely tragic, but realistically, I couldn't see Max killing all those people for a friendship she's only been back in for a week. I mean I know she feels bad about not contacting Chloe for the 5 years she was in Seattle, but clearly Chloe wasn't as important as her moving on with her life there, so I felt like although its a tough choice, that's the choice my Max would have made.

That being said, I cant wait to start a new playthrough with only Pricefield on the mind, and a big fuck you to everything else :D

On to the other part of this post, I have a few friends at work who dont really play video games, but are very intrigued by the game that fucked up their friend. So what I need is not only a recommendation for a lets play, but also whether or not you guys think it would be better for them to watch someone play through it silently, or with commentary. Normally, Let's Plays where people are commentating tend to annoy me, because they like to talk over the parts of the game I'm trying to listen to, and this would definitely be a problem for this game, but I would hope most streamers would know that since its a narrative game, they need to keep chit chat to a minimum. On the other hand, I think that reactions/discussions would be good for a lets play of this game, just because of some of the themes of the story.

So basically, what I'm asking is for all those people who have watched the Let's Plays that get thrown around this sub, which would be a good choice for someone who will look at it more as a TV show, but still be able to get the most out of the story?
/////////////////////
So I have dabbled in episodic games, mainly of course TellTale games, but have never found them too appealing. Didn't feel like anything mattered too much, too long between episodes, mediocre story, blah blah. Then comes into my Life a game called 'Life is Strange' and what a difference of mind it has made for me.

Episode 1 was solid. It set up and introduced things well and I loved the college and small port town atmosphere of the game so much. Max discovers the power, meets back up with Chloe, normal enough story so far.

Episode 2, again, was solid enough. The plot started to thicken and characters were becoming more interesting. I really thought it was neat seeing Chloe's reaction to fully understand Max's new ability. More bonding between the two of them. Then after an attempt to dissuade Kate, she jumps to her death. That honestly shocked me. Seeing her jump when I first turned the corner was not bad, because of my ability, but I never thought it could still turn out that way. 

Episode 3. This is where it hits me that this something more. This episode was fantastic. I honestly only remember being so filled with emotion at the end of this one, but remember having a great time with the rest of the episode. When you go back in time and change history, I thought it was so neat. Some smaller things were different (Victoria, Warren dating Brooke, etc.) But wait! William should be alive! And he is! Let us see how happy Chloe is! 

BAM! 

When I saw Chloe ride up to the door and just sit there looking at you, I had to put the controller down when the credits started. Had to take a break. What an emotional gripping journey.

Episode 4 just kept the train rolling. More clues, more plot, more actual danger. You are able to get to the party to track Nathan down, but he is not there. You need to leave, find that bastard. Another stroll in the junkyard, this time at night, this seems like the end of the episode, wonder when Nathan will pop out...

BAM! 

Max is drugged, Chloe killed! And Max cant use her power. That bastard Nath...JEFFERSON!?!

Episode 5. What a trip this was. The multitude of travelling between times and ending up back where it all started and being able to confront Jefferson. Man this just messed with my mind so much, but in a good way. It was satisfying to work through these different scenarios and figure them out so that things could be fixed. To see Jefferson taken down. I loved the part where you were taken down the path and were given so many of the times Chloe and Max soentr together, from episode 1 to now. With the knowledge we have know, it was interesting to see and think about those experiences again. Then it happens. You must choose. And I have to say, I made the selfish decision. I sacrificed Arcadia Bay. I cannot fathom that a game made me love a bond between these characters so much that I teared up at the thoughy of doing it all again, but without Chloe. I couldn't do it. I simply could not. 

Sorry if this was too long, but I needed to get this out somewhere and figured this was the place! 

TL;DR: Loved the game. Made me emotional. Couldnt lose friend, killed whole town. WTF just happened? 
/////////////////////
Hi guys, novice Life is Stranger, hot hooked on it just two days before and I'm playing Ep 4 right now. I really love the atmosphere/setting/story of the game, but one thing that struck me is how much I dislike most of the gameplay elements - namely the ones that I feel are there just to masquerade the fact that "Life is Strange" really is an interactive movie. 

For some reason that sounds like it's a takedown, but I don't intend it as such at all. I mean, I love experiencing the story, but the tedious walking around, stupid stuff like looking for beer bottles, [EP2_ SPOILERS](#s "the photo-focusing thing (I mean for when you travel back in time)...") I think the game would have been better and felt more HONEST about what it is if it had just skipped that stuff and really played to its strengths, namely the choices, and the story. The rest, to me, just distracts and seems like filler to make the game last longer without feeling meaningful (which I hate... as a busy person who prefers succinctness). To be clear, I'm not talking about the time manipulation, as obviously that's super core to what the game is.

I was wondering whether the community at large

1) agrees with me to some degree - or, do you think the game would have been worse off without these non-story based gameplay elements?

2) thinks the game would have fared worse if it didn't have these gameplay elements - are they an evil necessity to get gamers to buy it, and make it a success? Would it have been disparaged as "nothing but an interactive movie"..?

I'm sorry if this has been discussed at depth before - I mean, I'm sure it has, but I couldn't find those discussions.
/////////////////////
Def. late to the LIS party, got the game a couple of weeks ago on a whim (should have grabbed the collectors addition). I've been dragging it out because I've already fallen for this game, the amount of 'feels' this game has it messing me up as well as any game I've played (my favorites being the Bioshock series). I've just got to the end of Episode 4.

I've gotten a lot out of this episode, and my reaction to the end;

WHAT ARE YOU DOING MR. JEFFERSON!?
/////////////////////
Hey guys. I am frustrated as this game is not creating the necessary folders for save files. I have searched google, steam forums, reddit and nothing is fixing the issue. 

I have 3 hard drives. My OS is on my C drive, documents, pictures, media, videos on my E drive and Steam games/other games on my S drive. 

Upon starting and going through the game I get the save symbol at checkpoints. But when I exit and return the game restarts as if I didnt play. I checked the locations listed by many others for the Saves folder under My Life is Strange (which dont exist on ANY of my drives) and have went as far as to create them as others have done. Run as Admin, blah blah blah and the game doesnt save. 

I really want to enjoy it but playing from the beginning is killing this game for me. Is there anyone that can help? 
/////////////////////
there's no way to save her right? I'm doing a second play through and looking back at the first play through I did and I felt like I had false hope the whole time lmao.
/////////////////////
So I just finished the game for the first time yesterday, and it was *amazing*. No other game has made me feel as bad about my actions, made me as tense, or made me care as much about the major characters (Max included), as this one. My only quip was that the ending scene was short, and didn't feel very satisfying as a conclusion, but at the time I figured that they'd just left more room open for Season 2, so it didn't bother me much.


Once I stopped tearing up from EP5 and how terrible of a person it made me feel like, the first thing I did was try to find out everything I could about Season 2. I got even *more* upset when I learned that not only were they moving on to a new cast, but the devs said they felt Max's story was over.


After the one minute cutscene of Chloe and Max driving through the wreckage of the town, not saying anything to each other, or, you know, looking for survivors, and then driving off to get a fresh start in California, I'd have to disagree, but that's not the point.


So here's where I had my shower-thought: If they did have a new lead in Season 2, presumably with the same concept (someone gets time-travel powers, abuses it, and starts screwing everything up), why wouldn't Max involve herself with that?


She knows that the freak snowfall, dying animals, and tornado were all caused by her messing with time. If that started happening somewhere else, there's no way she would ignore it. She wouldn't know if it was her or someone else causing it, but odds are she would assume it was her fault.


There's no way that she could miss that news, either, since the freak weather patterns from Season 1 were being investigated by scientific groups all over the world. Even NASA tried to figure out what was causing it and couldn't. Max isn't the type to let things like that happen around her; she's too paranoid. If she sacrificed Arcadia Bay, she would be checking to make sure there wasn't freak weather anywhere else. If she sacrificed Chloe, she would be making sure the freak weather was gone for good. While all this is happening, she'd be doing even more research into her time control.


For her to avoid another area with weather exactly like Arcadia Bay's before the storm would have to be extreme apathy on her part. I don't expect her to show up right away, but it doesn't make logical sense to leave her out of the story completely.


So if this is all true, why would they say that Max's story is over? Well, they wouldn't technically be lying by saying that. If she got involved with the new cast later, it wouldn't be her story anymore. It would be sort of like calling Season 1 Chloe's story. She's a big part of it, but at the end of the day, Season 1 was more about Max than Chloe.


And all predictions aside, Max and Chloe are both likable, popular characters, and seeing what they (or just Max...) have been up to after Season 1 a few years later is just too cool of a concept for them to ignore. There's not much of a reason *not* to, either, since Max at least is still alive and well in the world, dealing with never using her ability, while at the same time someone else with the same power abuses it.


**TL;DR**: It doesn't make sense for Max to be left out of Season 2. She won't be the lead character, but she will almost definitely be involved at some point.
/////////////////////
Seriously fam, this game just was amazing. I can't even think straight. I played this all weekend. I forgot all about real life. It was that good. I hope they make another season.
Tears almost left my body when I saw Frank and Pompidu in the ending.
When I was on that dorm, it was so surreal, it was just... strange...
This is most definitely a master piece, even if it didn't make me cry, it is incredible.
/////////////////////
Hello again, guys and girls! Today, we shall have a topic about:

If LiS happened in the 80s, how different would it be and in what ways?
/////////////////////
[EP2_SPOILERS](#s And I am dead inside.

The worst has happened, I feel more fucking guilt than I thought possible for a fictional character. 

I let her down. I, me personally, let her down. I fucked up twice.

First, I ignored her call because I wanted to cherish time with Chloe (and encourage the Moe ship to sail) . Secondly, I failed to save her. I fucking hate myself. I feel so useless.

Victoria is a piece of vapid shit. I want to drown her.  In Nathan's blood.

I told Kate to wait for proof. I know how tricky and painful sexual assault can be. Still, I think it could have tipped her over the edge. 

I tried to shoot Frank, because I'm a good fucking person, and I blamed David.  

It's an amazing game. I'm hooked.

*"Oh, mother, I can feel... The soil falling over my head"*  )
/////////////////////
Now yes, Life is Strange ended in a great way, but could there be possibilities for a season 2?
/////////////////////
While playing this game I grew attached to Chloe really quickly. It was almost instantaneous, and I will explain why. First, I have to say that these are real events, this really happened to me. I spent so long trying not to believe it had happened, and I promise I'm not crazy.  This will be long, you've been warned.

When I was about 5 years old my brother and I went out to the backyard to play some baseball. It was going fine, and we were taking turns pitching and hitting. Well my brother was up to the plate, and trying to make him miss I threw the fastest ball I could. It wasn't good enough, and my brother was quicker because he nailed that ball. I mean that bat made one of the loudest cracking sounds I've ever heard. The ball, just flies straight and it's coming towards my face. Dead center right at my face. The speed at which this thing was going, and where it was going to hit (my nose) I thought I was going to die. If I didn't die, I knew I would be really hurt. I'm certain that's the way it would have happened, but no lie, the ball stops in mid air. I feel stupid even writing it. It just spins and floats in place for a solid 30 seconds. My brother had enough time to walk up to the ball, and we were walking around it just looking at each other like "what is happening" After about 30 seconds maybe a minute, the baseball just stops spinning and it falls to the ground. Straight down. I know it sounds like I'm making this up, honestly I wouldn't believe me either after hearing that. Hell, for the longest time, years, I never talked or thought about it. I really think I would have died that day being hit that hard on the nose at 5 years old, but I didn't. Something happened, I can't explain it and I'm not even going to try to anymore. I really had put it out of my mind until about 5 years back. My brother, who was extremely atheist, announced to the family that he was going to seminary school to be a pastor. He took me outside after a bit and asked me if I remembered the "time with the baseball". We talked about it, and he said that was one of the number one reasons he was going to become a pastor, why he believes. I'm not trying to convince anyone of a religion, I merely say it because it affected my brother that much. This wasn't the only time something like this happened either. There was the time I got a concussion, and not knowing I had one, fell asleep. I woke up fine. There was the time I drank kerosene at a party thinking it was water, and I'm fine. I've also been in two car accidents, been impaled, and lived through alcohol poisoning after drinking a quart of Jim Bean. I have always wondered if I was living through Final Destination in a way. I was suppose to die and death is following me. 

I know I sound crazy, and I wish I didn't. I know this is really fantastical, and things like this only happen in stories. I don't even know what I fully believe about all this yet. To be honest, other than my brother I've only told two people about this ever, because I know no one would believe me. 

Then there are my abandonment issues. When I graduated Basic Training, my father picked me up at the airport and told me that he was divorcing my mother. At this point I'm a grown man, and it doesn't really phase me. I mean, I easily came to terms with it. It happens, and at least he waited till his kids were grown. I can respect that. But then he started getting rough with mom, and I told her and begged her to leave that house. They were still living together because mom was trying to save the marriage. So she moved into her mother's place. My father at this point goes to the bar and starts sleeping with my daughter's mother. The only reason I found out was because I walked in on them. It destroyed me. Soon after they moved to Arizona together because they were so in love. My mother handled it worst than I did and wrecked the house, and started drinking a lot. She used me, and emotionally manipulated me for so many years. Only here recently have I been able to regain some control now. My brother had a wife, and one kid who were living in Kentucky because he was attending seminary school. Literally the only positive thing in my life was my childhood friend, I guess he was like my Max. We considered each other brothers because we grew up together (we've been friends since we were 6). I know the type of relationship Max and Chloe have, I've lived it. The way Chloe acts, the root reasons why, the things she fears. I not only can understand, but I can relate to. 

At the end of EP5 when you have to make the choice... I don't think I CAN choose to sacrifice Chloe. It would be like I was sacrificing myself. Furthermore, after the end credits, my past just flooded over me. Like Chloe I kind of just pushed it down and never really dealt with it. Now I'm faced to face with it, and I've been a wreck ever since. I literally can't listen to some of the OST, and every time I replay it it just takes me back to my past. I've been working through my past, because of this game, and Chloe is my real avatar. You can tell she's a good person, I mean seeing her when she was 13 years old will tell you that. It's just, things got complicated and she kept getting hurt. Unfortunately, people who are like that tend to be abrasive until you find the good person in them dying to come out. I know I'm like that. I feel terrible about the stupid pointless mean shit I do, I literally regret it all. It's just after a while having to act that way to just survive, you can't help but draw on that side first.  

I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time, but thanks for listening guys.

So, Taylor and Courtney both offered me fashion tips before I go to the party. Now I am already at the party but didn't had the chance to be pimped. Did I miss my opportunity or did the developers simply forgot? I like the moment when Max takes Rachels cloths but it's only temporary ... 

I found an artwork: http://imgur.com/mUp9jEj but I'm not sure if it's official part of the game.

Though I really love this game, I often wish for even more free decisions and a more complex reputation system. 
/////////////////////
Holy fucking shit. 

I love it. I absolutely adore the aesthetic.

The voice acting is pretty decent and the characters are a blast. I love the chemistry between Chloe and Max (ALL THE GODDAMN LESBIAN UNDERTONES), and the pop culture references. 

It has really made me appreciate the times we live in. The hipsters, the Internet culture, this folk-indie-acoustic pop fad, anime, the lingo... I can really see teenagers of tomorrow looking back thinking, "God I wish I lived in the 00's/20-teens..." 

It's fucking great.  I can feel the nostalgic, melancholic tone over every scene.
/////////////////////
I bought the game on the 11th of March (Chloe's Birthday - Life *IS* indeed strange) played through the first two episodes, then played a marathon 9 hour run from Ep2 to conclusion of Ep5. 

I decided about midway, somewhere around Chloe accidently shooting herself in the junkyard and her getting trapped on the tracks, that I would throw out everything I'd learned about messing with time from things like Back to the Future, Doctor Who, and Quantum Leap, I would save this girl nomatter what the universe threw at me, Butterfly Effect be damned!

And then I decided to save Chloe's dad. It made sense, I could make her life SO much better...I would just make one teeny tiny change, like Groundhog Day, I unplugged the phone, and hid Williams keys, making damned sure there was no way he was getting in that car... I was a God. I had made something right that once went wrong... And then I went back to the present, and found out what a complete mess I'd made of things.

After heartbreakingly granting Alternate Chloe's final wish, I returned things to the way they were. and was overjoyed to see Chloe back to her normal self.

Around about that time, Kate died, I lost my powers, and really started doubting myself, but I figured I would fix Kate somewhere between saving the world, stopping my best friend from getting killed - a lot, and dealing with Frank, Nathan, and the Vortex Club. 

Just to top it off, I suddenly had a psychotic teacher to stop. "You have a gift, Max" he said, and there I was thinking "Oh you have NO idea, just show me a photo, ANY photo, and you're history pal"

After intervention from David, who seemed to have died almost as many times as Chloe, I went through hell... literally, to get to the lighthouse, where I made the choice I knew I would make right back at the start. Without a thought, I tore the photo in half, saving Chloe, and dooming the town. Max and Chloe belong together, and love conquers all...even time and fate itself. 

After playing, I just sat there staring into space for a long time. I'd made some good choices, but also some really bad ones. I'd let a lot of people die, just to save one person. I could feel the weight of responsibility Marty McFly, The Doctor, and every other time travelling hero feels. But somehow through it all I felt that the outcome was right. it felt complete and satisfying...I still never saved that bird from hitting the window though, so maybe I'll take Max for one...more...rewind.


/////////////////////
Obviously you all know it, but this game is beautiful. Money well spent. The way this game is presented I think is the key to many things this game acomplishes greatly: playing as a highschool student during a week is so simple and normal, a thing we all have been throught. The way you interact with characters throught those days, how they evolve (thanks to the events on Blackwell, otherwise, people won't change much in just 5 days) makes them characters you can empathyze with. They feel alive, human, close... more than most videogame characters.
I've looked for a game where player decisions counted and changed the storyline. I expected that for Mass Effect, until I got *MassEffect3'd*...

The story is great, really inmersive, sadly it's too short. For me, the climax is finding Rachel's body near the end of EP4. Then the game goes downhill. But first I'll write about other various things.

You start LiS on the 5th day storm, in your vision. You follow the doe, which I thought it was Max spirit animal (mainly bc of the shirt). You didn't change the timeline yet, so it's not coherent that you have this visions (I know, narrative resource and all of that). Then Chloe dies and you quantum-leap back in time (doesn't happen ever again in the game).

The vision made me think that the lighthouse would be important per se (i.e: magic inside) not just the place where you made the final choice. I also expected the native americans and the Tobanga to be important on the story. That the storm could be caused by other magically empowered person that you have to stop. Obviously, the game is too short for that.

I enjoyed the game, I surely did. I'm the kind of guy who never see things coming in fiction (I always make up strange and improbable theories), so I wasn't expecting the game to be a mix between Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko.

Those are movies, this is a videogame. What works for one may not work for the others. Basically the huge difference is that we take an active role on videogames, while movies are consumed and enjoyed in a pasive way.

I felt like the parts where you go into photos weren't necesarry. It complicates the game and messes with all your decisions you've made throught game. (Althought the alternative timeline with disabled Chloé is heartbreaking).

And that is my biggest problem with Life is strange. I got *MassEffect3'd* again. In the end it was all reduced to a left-right choice.

You can save Chloe (which you should do, because you spent all game saving and helping her) but all your decisions and interactions you made throught game won't mind as they'll be erased by a huge tornado.

You can sacrifice Chloe (which you should do, because she was meant to die and then you fcked up the timeline) and the ending will reflect some of your choices. But then all gameplay with Chloé was for nothing.

Even worst is the fact that the game is almost telling you that the correct ending is sacrificing Chloe.

Like I said at the beginning, the beauty of LiS is the simplicity and closeness and the end is too big for that. It's the kind of game that deserves a "happy" ('cause Rachel is dead in the end) ending.
I expected that if the game would have a "deep-sad-timey-wimey" end, it would be one where your powers would change the timeline so Rachel never dies and leaves Arcadia with Chloe. You'll be "sacrificing" Chloe as the events on that week would never happen and you'll probably never see her again.
Even the game suggest that you get your powers to solve Rachel's mistery (as the doe fades away when you find the body).

I choose to save Chloe, but that end isn't as rewarding as the other one. And if the theory is true, she'll continue dying. Will Max always have her powers to save Chloe? What are the source of said powers? Too many questions.

We deserve a Life is Strange 2. The problem is always how to continue a game with multiple endings. But all those who choose to let Chloe die have their story arch closed. So I'd say "screw that" and continue to the other ending. The other guys will be mad, but it's a game where you can change your choices. Max and Chloe could figure a way back...

The game makes me feel that sacrificing Chloe is the right choice. And I hate it. I refuse to let her die.

So yesterday in the Discord chat, I was given an idea by a user to replace all the Life is Strange subtitles with gangsta subtitles, by running all the subtitles through Gizoogle and then replacing the original subtitles with the gangsta ones. 


Here's some pics:

Also I marked this as EP2 spoilers because of the last image. 


So far I've done all of EP1, a small portion of EP2 and most of the "menu" options too. 

EDIT: Here is a download link: http://www.nexusmods.com/lifeistrange/mods/10/?


It only has EP1 and EP2 done so far. Well, EP1, EP2 and some of the menus. 





/////////////////////
I finished the game like....5 moths ago or so but I'm still thinking about it.There isn't a day that I wouldn't listen to the soundtrack or searching for fan arts.

/////////////////////
After many months of saying it, I finally have everything I need to create a music video with the song Sound of Silence. I am for sure using some storm scenes. I'm definitely making one with the Disturbed version, but I may also make a different one with the Simon and Garfunkel version. 
I need to decide which scenes to use, and would like some input if anyone has ideas.
/////////////////////
the more I feel like he is in so many ways even more doomed than Chloe.

He's born into a family that's closer to a business than a caring group of humans. His father constantly pressures him to be the perfect Sean Prescott 2.0 and next CEO.

As if the insight in Nathans situation wasn't dire enough as stated in countless letters, emails and the drugs he kept taking, this fucking voicemail on the drive to the diner hit me harder than Chloes breakdown after finding Rachel.

I always believed that once you get to know a person 1 on 1 you can *always* sympathise with them. And I was right, what he said was genuine and sincere. But it was only moments before his inevitable death that he was given the very first chance to say this.

And this fucks me up, no matter what you could have done, he was doomed. There would have always been that father treating him like a packaged good. There would always be him breaking under all the pressure. There would almost always be him trying to be the popular and successful man his father wanted by teaming up with Jefferson.

And if you bust them? He likely gets to jail in either scenario of him killing Chloe or being busted by David beforehand for killing Rachel.

If his best outcome is to be sent into an US prison and hope for mental healthcare there, then this poor boy was never given any chance in life.
/////////////////////
I was reading about theories on how Max's time travel works and this user made a really interesting point on the Chloe we save or sacrifice. 

http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/827469-life-is-strange/72703166

To get straight to the point it seems like LIS time travel works as so.
1) Rewinding time only changes the current reality/timeline we are in.
2) Traveling through photos creates alternate realities where multiple max's coexist. Case in point, Chloe calling out Max for forgetting things or welcoming her back when Max returns from another reality. 

When Chloe dies from Mr. Jefferson, Max only "saves" her by moving to another reality by using a photo in the dark room. This means that an alternate reality Chloe, and not the original Chloe, is with us at the very end. Remember, we saved Chloe the first time in the bathroom by rewinding time; thus, preserving the original Chloe.

I would love to hear what others think about this theory.
/////////////////////
So yea, before anyhing, i´m writing this for two purposes: to actually express myself somehow because i know this subreddit is the perfect place to do so, and also well, if it kind of helps somebody feel better, it will be my pleasure. Like many of you guys i´ve just finished playing LiS a couple of days ago, Tuesday. I´m a guy, 24, on last semester of university, kinda introvert (as many of you i beleive), not an english native speaker (so many errors ahead) and really trying to enjoy everything: family, few friends, an almost fiancé whom is also my best friend, etc. I know life isn´t about money and pride so i can consider myself somebody who´s "got it right" on some areas which is fine. But i´m also so full of mistakes and incredibly huge errors. I tell you all these to try to make a point later. 
My sister and me played it together (on different games actually, but played episodes simultaneously and watched each other play, for example she could save Kate while i couldn´t) but i finished it first by myself at 4 a.m.

The feelings the ending awoke just won´t go away. I´ve listened to Obstacles for like a zillion times this past couple of days, watched almost ever reaction video on youtube and cried with them almost every time, i´ve started to write my own fan fiction and i´m getting totally obsessed with the idea that i´m madly in love with Maxine Caulfield. This subreddit has felt like a safe haven since, so i beleive it´s useless to tell you about how my decision was completely BAE even though i´m not Pricefield (terms i´ve learned from you guys in these days) but my curiosity watching the alternative (or "correct" ending as some of you would tell) totally felt like brokeness, and, as many of you, it feels good to speak my mind or just talk about it. My sister and me avoid talking much about it because we know that even though we are aware (as most of you!) that this game isn´t real and neither Max or Chloe, we are real, and our feelings for them are real, some of us mourn Chloe as if she was OUR real friend who died, some (like me) are in love with Max or Chloe and cannot help but think that we will be truly happy until we find somebody totally like them, some of us regret and cry because we haven´t experienced a friendship so unconditional like Max and Chloe (even though we just saw moments of it on 5 virtual days), some of us just wish we could be there, huging them, feel close to them, their hearts, their voices. Some of us are even more attached and want to BE them, and BE arcadians, or Blackwells, nothing else will satisfy. Life becomes frustraiting and dull and we enter on a void because deeply it feels like we know that feeling won´t go away until we acheive what our heart desires, but...the thing is, we know it isn´t real, even if we try it to be and fight that horrible idea. Finally i beleive most of us can identify a little with all the above mentioned. All of those feelings are real my friends.
I think most of us have a condition, a "something" on our brain that makes us feel this because of our tendency for extreme empathy, while some people just contemplate from an outer view a great story, and maybe cry because of it and then move on, we just stop there because for us it wasn´t just a story, it was our reality for a time. Games tend to make us feel this more than movies or maybe series (i can´t speak for books cause it's pretty much the same on many people cases) we learn to adapt to different realities and enjoy/suffer the feeling of letting them go to the point of becoming addicted to that feeling and that´s because we don´t want to face ours, even though you can mark your own reality as worse, "nice enough" or even "better than" (for example, in my case better than Chloe´s; a hitting stepdouche is not my case) it just doesn´t feel that its enough to fill the size of the hole. I dont beleive it´s completely related to that.
Today i saw the girl im completely convinced is my other half, she doesn´t comprehends at full scale this crap, but undestands completey how hard is for some of us to let go something not real, when i talked to her i thought "well yea, she isn´t Max or doesnt even look like her, but how i´m sure that a Max would be better than her? is it REALLY what i want?" Well. It wasn´t
That kept me thinking on something i read yesterday, some girl was saying that she had a friend like Chloe, which was a great freindship but completely ended up destroying everything on her own life. That´s because we also have flaws, and that´s what life is, a series of good memorable moments but also bitter ones, people we love but also they hurt us sometimes. Can you imagine Chloe provoking Max, or hitting her? Or making her cry with horrible words because of pride? Or jealousy? Well, even on their universe it could happen. That´s because we are human and even though life can be full of good stuff, bad and sad stuff also happen. Or even nothing happens on our own lives. 
So, finally, something that made me feel a little better (i was also aided by so many of your fanarts, fanfictions, videos, etc of all of you) was to think that, even though our own story lacks many of the awesome things or relationships or people we see on our beloved fictions to the point we crave them and cry because of them, it´s still our own story, the one God puts in front of us. Maybe if we try changing something, like many of you have said, reconcile with that old friend or familiar. This guy i read about started working out and well, it helped him. Let´s make an effort here (including myself) to appreciate what we have, (or even what we lack!) who knows, maybe our life is just about to begin, maybe it hasn´t been the best time of our lives to have that very "special" friend, even if we are old, maybe you will find that there is a potential great friend on some forgotten family or an old freindship, maybe you´re supposed to be THAT friend who "rescues" someone who´s feeling like life is a lost cause. All of our stories are super different. Let´s all take all the great stuff we learned from Max and Chloe and, like that scene from Pixar´s Up where Mr Friedericksen reads Ellie´s final note on her old adventure book, let´s go get more and build that photo album on our own because we cannot go back like Max. Well, this is just my humble opinion on a subreddit that has helped me a lot (: Thank you guys, for everything.
/////////////////////
and I am not the least bit sad or emotional. I got the game last night and played the first episode, and finished the last 4 today. I mean, it was a little sad, but I was just more confused about wtf was happening, especially in episode 5.
/////////////////////
For example, In My Mind. It's been in my head a bunch this week, listening to it now, and it might as well be Chloe singing.

    And when they put me in the ground
    I'll start pounding the lid
    Saying I haven't finished yet
    I still have a tattoo to get
    That says I'm living in the moment

Then again, the first few lines say

    In my mind, in a future five years from now

So that's either a coincidence or the song was written for the game. But still, out of all the music in the world, how do they find such PERFECT music?

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents! Today, we shall have a topic about:

If you had to choose between getting only the 2nd season of LiS, but it would be of perfect quality, or getting many more LiS seasons, up to even 10, but they all would be mediocre, which one would you pick? Why?
/////////////////////
Okay so Max caused the storm by using her powers in the first place, or is it just Chloe's fate to die there?

If yes to the first then why was she still able use her knowledge of time travel and and take down jefferson but not save chloe?
/////////////////////
After playing LIS and watching The Butterfly Effect, I think it gave me a slight irrational fear. 
I don't know if it has a name, but its a fear of blacking out and not knowing what I've done during my moments of unawareness.

For example when Max goes back to stop William from dying "Past Max" obviously doesn't remember hiding his keys after "Future Max" has returned to her time, otherwise she would know that she hid the keys for a reason and other things that happen in the future.... so she has no recollection for that time "Future Max" is in control. So for the rest of her life up to the moment "Future Max" wakes up in her time she's had no idea she saved Williams life. Even then Max obviously has no recollection of the altered timeline, otherwise she would have known that Chloe was paralysed.

So thats my new fear (Obviously not due to time shenanigans), But I just fear that throughout my life I've had these little blackouts where I've acted strangely, or done something that makes people get the wrong impression, and I have no idea that its happened.
Others would accept that as me and not inform me of my strange behaviour, and this could of been happening all my life.

I don't know if anyone else has a fear like that but it's always just there in the back of my mind.
/////////////////////
So I just started playing this game and I really want to play more but for some reason the audio is messed up. The music sounds fine and most of the time everything is fine, but at random times or when I talk to people the voices are just gone, or sometimes they're quiet and echoey. Anyone know how to fix this?
/////////////////////
So I downloaded last night and had a bit of a play around but didn't really get into anything. I knew today I was free all day so thought I'd have a marathon. 


So now I've been playing for 12 hours and I'm a complete mess. The end of episode 2 I was near hysterical. I drove to get groceries for a break, but was crying on the drive there. Now I've just finished episode 3 and I'm so... Empty. What the fuck is this game and whyyyyy did I think it was a good idea? 


I actually just feel like I need to talk to someone about this. Please tell me I'm not alone in having such a gut wrenching reaction to the game?
/////////////////////
Does anybody else feel like when Mr Jefferson raises his voice that it is out of character? The calm focused sociopath Mr Jefferson is much more appealing for an antagonist such as him. He appears weak and interrupted when he loses control.
/////////////////////
It's a type of game that I rarely play, so what sort of mentlity is best for playing? I generally find it helps know what kind of armosphere you'll experience beforehand.

Hey all.So yesterday I was checking some fan fictions and stuff and somehow I came across a video that was an inspired song from the game.I was amazed by it and then I decided to check his other songs.All of them are amazing and beautiful.I recommend going to his channel.You won't be disappointed :)

Hi everyone! I have i problem with my PC copy of LiS.. The gameplay and everything is fine, but once i try to start talking to an NPC, the game won't play any voice-overs. I originally completed the game on my PS4 and i wanted to replay it on my PC, but it's not quite the same experience without any voice-overs. I was wondering if any of you had a solution to this?
/////////////////////
That scene totally freaked me out the first time I played it. It wasn't until later when I realized that it was just a nightmare. When the birds started hitting the window, I thought the tornado was hitting the town early. During the hallway scenes, I thought Max got trapped in some type of other alternate timeline with other timelines colliding into one because Kate was there.

What freaked me out the most was when Max was running from Jefferson and all those people with flashlights. I honestly thought that Max somehow ended up in a trapped purgatory\ hell world that she couldn't get out of. The whole place felt void and empty. A type of timeline that Max is stuck in and can't get out. It also felt a place where Max was being punished for her time traveling sins and that *no one can help her*. All the buildings and walls and such were so disoriented and dark blue it was peaceful and scary both at once.

When I reached the dark room, thats when I realized it was all really just a dream\ nightmare. The whole thing felt long, but I liked some parts more than others.
/////////////////////
I lived in Bandon oregon for a few years until my hubby died there. He was born there too, thought he'd escaped but we had to go back for some stupid reason during the recession and it killed him. Towns that think they're the next Monterey don't usually do well. Everytime the song One Headlight by Jakob Dylan comes on I'm reminded of Bandon especially the lyrics "..this place is always such a mess sometimes I think I'd love to watch it burn" either that or Hotel California.

Bad things are happening to girls in Arcadia Bay and the impending doom just feels like comeuppance to me.

Anyways I hate the town, it is very triggering to me. I wonder if it's modeled after bandon because of the Steves Crab shack and we have a few diners like that one. But probably not. Newberg is way farther than 60 miles. It's like a hodgepodge of dead-end quaint tourist traps.

/////////////////////
I'll try to keep this spoiler free. I've finished the game months ago but almost everyday now, every post I see about beating the game I read that they either cried or got teary eyed. Not that I'm saying that's a bad thing. I enjoyed the game, played the shit out of it, couldn't wait for the next episode, and got all the achievements. It was an unexpected hit for me that I thought I would never like but ended up loving it. I had a good amount of feelings for most of the characters and I mean shit, I felt really bad for Nathan towards the end. Basically this is one of those games I get sucked into and I immerse myself in . I could relate to Max in a good amount of ways. But when it came down to it I didn't feel any need what so ever to cry, or even teary eyed. I don't lack any empathy but I felt that I was supposed to feel something that wasn't really there. Am I broken or something?

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents! Today, we shall have a topic about:

[Happy Birthday Chloe.](http://guides.gamepressure.com/lifeisstrange/gfx/word/432115655.jpg)
/////////////////////
Is there a name for the style she uses for her journal? 
/////////////////////
I just now finished playing LiS for the first time and I'm left speechless by this beautiful game.

One really cool thing i noted during the play-through was that after Max wakes up with Chloe on the beach after telling Chloe what to do, the clothes they're wearing changes from what they were wearing at Blackwell. 

Max is wearing a red shirt with an image of death on the front, and Chloe is wearing a shirt with the Ouroboros, the snake swallowing it's own tail. 

I think it was really cool that the clothing so accurately showed the dilemma that Max and Chloe were in.
Max's decisions ultimately affects who lives or dies, giving her the power of Death itself, and Chloe's fate was to die no matter what, ultimately bringing her back to the same place no matter what Max did. 

Any other cool details/symbolism that you guys picked up on?
/////////////////////
Seems like everyone in the subreddit is bae &gt; bay but I never kissed her, never really understood our undying love for her, thought she was pushy and rude and not in a cute way, and I did not hesitate at all when the final choice came. It always seemed to me like Max was just going along because of their shared past but really they had nothing in common.
/////////////////////
I am a bi sexual female (have been for many years) and I have to say that this game was awesome to play not just because I enjoyed the plot, graphics, art style, etc. but also because I connected with the characters on a level I'm not used to. It isn't everyday to come across characters in video games who (when they do have a romantic interest) aren't straight. I acknowledge that there are other video games with LBGT characters like Home Alone &amp; GTA but these are secondary characters rather than primary. Anyway, would love to hear if anyone else had a similar experience/any stories to tell.
/////////////////////
Have played LiS five times now and am really interested in playing it through with a romance between Max and Chloe but I just can't seem to make it happen! Last time I played through I kissed her and turned down Warren at the end but still felt there was no attraction between them. Towards the end of my journal Max referred to Chloe as a best friend with no hint of more. Is this interpretation? Does anybody have any journal entries they could share, or choice suggestions? I agreed to Go Ape with Warren (don't hurt me) but never saw that as a romantic choice.

Personally I was so involved with the plot and everything going on that Max not having any romantic feelings towards anybody felt normal to me, but I would love to play it through again forming an attraction to Chloe, and maybe another playthrough for Warren if possible :)

Hi guys! I need some help with a terrible issue I can't fix: I am at the point when I "change" the past throwing out the door William's keys. I'm back to the camp in an alternative reality and I go on a bus, but when Max is watching the sunset the game freezes (with the music still playing). The last updates are installed and I have tried to re-start from the last savepoint but it keeps freezing. What can I do? Have some of you had the same issue?
/////////////////////
I was looking at some fanart, and came to a realization. If I ever were to see a blue butterfly in real life, I'm not sure how I would react. I'd probably cry a little, or get overly excited, because "hey, it's the butterfly from LiS." Obviously I'd try to take a picture. I don't see many butterflies where I live (Oregon), I see white ones occasionally, or if I go visit my grandparents in the summer, I might see an orange one. But, now I really want to see a blue one, but I'm not sure where in Oregon I would be lucky enough to see a blue butterfly.

I'm in episode 1, I took the hammer and it shows up in my inventory. Even then the game tells me to get a hammer when trying to break the alarm?
/////////////////////
Did anyone's Max fall for Warren?

I felt sorry for him with his cute, earnest and fumbling approaches.

I kissed him in the diner.  Not because I had feelings for him but because I was mostly sure I was going to let him die.  I wanted to give him have something that would make his last moments happy.  (That sounds a lot more twisted in retrospect than it felt at the time).

Could Warren have been made more attractive to Max or was his role meant to highlight the receiving side of unrequited love?

Hey,

in a few weeks a good friend of mine celebrates his birthday and i want to gift him a LIS LE.
I want to pack it nicely in LIS style but i dont have any ideas..
Any suggestions?
/////////////////////
I started the game at 3PM and finished at 2AM. Wow, what a ride. The storyline with Chloe's dad hit really hard because I lost my dad a few years ago and sometimes feel like my life took a downward turn because of it. What an excellent game, beautiful cinematics, enticing story, and incredible soundtrack. I've never been moved to tears by a game and I think I'm a pretty tough guy. Glad to have gone on this journey.

___

This games has changed my current life and will most likely continue to do so for the rest of it.

This game in its beauty has saved my life from suicide.

This game has helped me get into a mentally healthier form.

This game is *Life is Strange.*

I love this game, it is the first game I've played to make me cry, the first game I've played to make me laugh uncontrollably and the first game to make me want to *live*. The game makes me strive to have a life, a reason, a friendship, a relationship, a sense of danger and sense of love in a neat package. 

I was helped by this game more than any type of therapy I'd gotten. [](#s "Kate") saved me, as stupid as it sounds. I don't know where I'd be, if anywhere, without this game. 

I was going through a huge state of mental unhealthiness (don't know the term at the minute, sorry) from around December 2013 until September 2015. I was addicted to thinking of suicide and couldn't get my mind off of how crappy of a person I was. I found out about this game when I heard about someone called JackSepticEye play it in around June of 2015.

I watched till Episode 4 and proceeded to buy the full season on Xbox One and Steam. I played Episode 5 without a clue as to what would be in it. I loved every bit of this game, and still do. I couldn't tell you one con due to the extreme bias I have towards it. It saved me.

The extreme themes in this game (rape, suicide, bullying, drugs) are what helped me. Seeing [](#s "Kate, one of my favourite characters"), [about to](#s "jump off a building") gave me a huge slap in my face. Tears poured down my eyes then and even thinking about it now those tears form back. [I didn't want](#s "Kate to jump"). [I didn't want](#s "her to go"). Then I realised that's what people might think of me.

But anyway, I'm going off topic. Now I just want to say: When I hear music from Life is Strange, hear quotes from Life is Strange, play Life is Strange or think about Life is Strange, I can't help but cry, and I need to thank DONTNOD for such an amazing game.

What did you guys think of the game as a whole?
/////////////////////
So I just beat the game about 3 days ago now, and I immediately replayed it. To be honest I'm fighting back the urge to play it again. Anyway there have been some thinks floating around my head, and I have to get them out because I can't stop thinking about this game. I'll try to make it as quick as possible (which means I won't fully go into every detail) to avoid a TLDR respond, but it seems unavoidable to some extent. 

I loved how they used Native American culture as the backbone of the world. The use of spirit animals and the Native American thoughts about time travel was really refreshing. It's obvious that Max has the deer since she keeps seeing the doe and wears a lot of cloths with deer on them. Joyce is obviously the whale, since she works at the two whale's diner. The three I want to go into are Chloe, Rachel, and William. There seems to be a lot of debate between Chloe and Rachel. Chloe has to the butterfly. The butterfly represents transformation, and as we see she has completely transformed from her sweet loving self into an antsy and full of rage teenager. The butterfly is also hinting on her part of the butterfly effect, she IS the butterfly effect. Rachel has to be the blue jay. First she is wearing a blue jay feather earring in her picture. Second, the spirit animal of the blue jay is able to transverse the land of the dead and the living. That's why they apparently have the white and black marks on their wings. When you take that selfie in Chloe's bathroom, and the blue jay is behind you it doesn't show up in the picture. I think this is because its Rachel's spirit animal trying to guide you. In fact, every time you see a blue jay its in a place that is connected to Rachel and nowhere else. Furthermore, when the birds start dying, it's the only one unaffected. My last point is that once you find Rachel's body, you don't see anymore blue jays. I think her spirit animal was trying to guide you throughout the story in hopes that you'd find her. Everytime it popped up, it was saying "You're getting closer". This makes sense within the butterfly effect, because since Chloe was saved in the bathroom Rachel's body would never have been found and that's suppose to happen just as much as everything else. So to fix the timeline, the spirit animal is guiding you alone. Now onto William, he doesn't have a spirit animal but he does have a symbol. He is the lighthouse, and they symbolize guidance and safety. I say this because when you go back 5 years Chloe is wearing a lighthouse shirt and William took her to the lighthouse. So was happy, worked hard at school, and was very light tempered. She was being guided by William, but when he died she changed because his guidance wasn't there anymore. Furthermore, when William is alive she never has a vision of the lighthouse being torn apart. I know some other characters have spirit animals but they seem to be minor in comparison. 

Another thing I wanted to get out was the use of the butterfly effect. At first I was thinking that the hurricane (it's in water its not a tornado) was trying to kill Chloe, but once Max said it was her doing it seemed to click. The butterfly effect is all about how when there are a lot of variables an action's reaction intensifies. So the fact that Chloe survived the bathroom encounter means that Max had to keep changing variables by rewinding. Every time she uses her power it changes and intensifies the variables of the timeline. So Chloe surviving the bathroom encounter is like a butterfly (heyyyy spirit animal) flapping it's wing once. This would cause a little disturbance so it snows in 80 degree weather. But then you have to rewind again to save Chloe from shooting herself and from the train. Two more flaps. Then Kate is driven to suicide, because the last straw was with Jefferson and he should've been locked up by now. Another flap. And so it goes, but at the end if you choose to sacrifice Chloe, Max would literally have no reason to use her rewind power at all. But if you sacrifice the bay, all those changes amounted into this terrifying hurricane, and much like hurricanes or any weather pattern, once the hurricane is done the timeline has been equalized and everything is reset. And please, let's not kid ourselves. Part of the point of the nightmare was to show you who was going to die. That's why they kept talking about Max killing them. Everyone in that room did not survive if you sacrificed the bay. The magic of this game, and the reason I believe it's so hard to get over, is that even though the setting has fantasy elements there are moments where there was no more time magic, you had to come to terms with everyday, relatable, scenes. You were confronted by the dark realities of life. While I'm on the ending, I just want to say I liked the binary ending. I really didn't see how it could have been anything else really. To me the ending was about accepting the death of your friend, or denying it. You could accept Chloe's death and have everyone live (i.e. you accept her death and don't become bitter) or you can deny her death and lose everyone else (i.e. deny her death and become jaded. Much like Chloe did when her father died) It was about coming to terms with reality and learning how to move on. How to see that bad things happen to everyone, and we all have our own butterfly effect going on in our own lives. We all have to give up something in order to exist. 

These were just some things I was thinking about after finishing the game and reading a few articles. I couldn't, obviously, be totally wrong but let me know what you think. Again these thoughts are not fully explained as they are more developed in my mind. I do have one question though, I do want to play through it again. I really think this game has ruin every other game for me. I fear I'll get burnt out on it. Is that possible?  
/////////////////////
I chose to sacrifice Arcadia Bay. How about you?
/////////////////////

/////////////////////
So I was playing through episode 5 again, and I got to the bit where Max pops David a text message telling him where to go and what to do in order to solve the case he's started... I'm awfully confused.

This text message is sent right at the very, very start of the game. She deletes it from her phone so that 'auto-Max' doesn't know about it, but then how come David is still kicked out of the house (he mentions being kicked out after knocking out Jefferson)? Surely he would have mentioned the message to her at some point over time and she would no longer be suspecting of him?

Or am I being silly and was the text message sent anonymously?
/////////////////////
Hello again, guys and girls! Today, we shall have a topic about:

Did you feel like any of the characters had some major design flaws, whether it was character or looks wise? Why?
/////////////////////
I was somewhat disappointed with the way the developers brought us to Rachel's fate. Don't get me wrong, overall I thought the game was absolutely great and finding Rachel's body/how she was killed did fit well with the story but I feel as though they could have gone a different direction. 

For example, when Chloe and Max discovered the Dark Room in the barn they could have been rescuing Rachel who had been down there for months being held prisoner as a model for Mr. Jefferson's sick delights.

Which leads me to my DLC idea, would it not be awesome if they made a DLC of Max going back via a picture to save Rachel? And the possible alternate realities that come about from Max saving her from death but having to save her from another situation as a result (like the one mentioned above). Until finally being able to save her and have her 'mesh' into the regular timeline, so to speak.

Thoughts?
/////////////////////
I just got finished playing Life is Strange on the Xbox One and it was an amazing game!! Definitely lives up to all of the hype, but there have been a couple things nagging at me since I stopped playing. 

1. When Max sees Chloe in her paralyzed state, why didn't she find a picture of before the accident happened and go back to that to convince Chloe not to go driving and thus preventing her fate?

2. When Max is freed from the Dark Room by David and she calls Warren about the picture, why not just have him take a picture of the pic with his phone and send it to her? It would have been a lot easier than driving to the diner during a tornado.

This is mostly just me knit-picking at what is otherwise a great game, but still things worth mentioning.

/////////////////////
So I just finished Ep 5 last night. Bay over bae because Kate is my real bae. However there are two small things I feel really weird about the ending:
1. Jefferson got arrested although if Max decided not to change anything in original timeline. Of course she has all the information to do it but wouldn't it mean another butterfly effect? Nathan could also spill the beans but he idolize Jefferson so very unlikely.
2. Why does Kate/Warren and some of Max's other classmates attends Chloe's funeral? Chloe is a former Blackwell's student but not that popular. Warren don't even know Chloe in this timeline. And I doubt Kate is friend with a rebellious punk like Chloe.

(Sorry for the repost, I had to make a few quick edits and accidentally hit the delete button).

A bit of TL;DR but I do appreciate those that can bear with me.
Long(ish) time lurker, first time poster.

I'll get it out of the way that I'm pretty ambivalent about this game at the best of times, I didn't seem to like it as much as other people and that's fine. Some people got more out of it and that's perfectly valid. I'd probably give it an overall score of 6.5 (probably about an 8 at its very best moments, about a 3 at its worst).

As jilted as some of the dialog was between the characters there was still something endearing about the relationship with Max and Cloe.
I'd played all the way through the game on the suggestion of a friend, though I'm not usually the type for point and click adventures- I did like what I'd seen of the art style (it definitely speaks to all the work the developers put in when you realize most of it was hand-painted). I saw enough in it that I was able to continue through, and it was certainly a journey.

Which brings me to my point. My best friend starting from 7th grade and all the way through high school into our first year of college was openly lesbian (I'm a guy, so that didn't stop people from thinking we were dating, and we did for a very brief period, but she came out later on in HS). We were both troubled punk kids when we were younger and I guess that's why we'd gravitated towards each other.

We'd even gone to the same college together, same program, and gotten an apartment together. She's definitely someone who's helped mellow me out considerably, and lord knows where I'd be without her.

She died in December of 2010, and I'd just regressed to being mad as hell about everything again (but in a considerably more manageable way than when I was growing up). There was a long period of time where I'd struggled with it, and had after a while had just decided to move on without getting any closure. Shut it out completely so I could at least function.

Fast forward to early 2016, and I'm doing pretty well. I'm also back in school finishing the degree that I'd set out to do so many years ago. A friend had recommended me the game because I'm a "quirky art student" (her words, not mine). whatever that meant, I'd given it a go anyways.

I'd gotten to the end of the game a couple of nights later. And we all know the choice that comes with that. I'd opted to sacrifice Chloe with some hesitation.

As soon as the gun went off I'd flinched, and when the music started playing there was something familiar about it. And then it hit me, her sister did an acoustic rendition of Spanish Sahara at her funeral, and I'd heard that CD playing all the time at her house (I guess it'd come out that year).

The next 11 minutes completely destroyed me. I don't think I could have been any more devastated if someone were showing me a slideshow of mine and my friend's life together clockwork orange style. There was a point where I'd considered stepping away and coming back to it but endured and was a complete mess by the end, and for about 20 minutes after.

I probably would have been affected if the choice of music were different (thought they synced it up perfectly), absolutely, but so much of why it got to me was because it carried such mixed memories.

Anyways, there's my experience, and I appreciate those that stuck with me through it. You now have my permission to exhale.

Hi! Thought I'd ask you guys, since I'm divided on the topic.
So, LiS is amazing. Played it myself, loved it, cried balls, still not healed yet. I convinced my girlfriend to buy the game, because I know she'd love it. She looked it up and mentioned that Chloe looks just like me, so she was sold right from there.

She hasn't started playing it yet. I was just wondering, in your opinion, is LiS a game that's best enjoyed in the privacy of your own room for hours straight, or is it a game where she can play it while I sit and watch her, comment (non spoiler of course), etc?
Her reaction to this is important to me. Because reasons.
I may be slightly selfish here just because I miss the game so much lol

Thanks for all input.
