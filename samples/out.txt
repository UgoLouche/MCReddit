I have just recruited a new member of the feels train, if you will. I have absolutely no one walking around was crushing.

The alternate reality that we enter after saving William. I'm sure everybody here remembers, instead of just watching. (and I'm not one to cry at video games 
(or anything for that matter) affected me so much is because I envy them. Despite the f**ked up things that happened to anyone else outside the school, she heads back to her dorm 
to get the flash drive. She goes out of the dorms, is forced to save Alyssa from a flying rugby ball, then go confront/watch the altercation with David in Chloe's 
bedroom, which was a lot of fun. We're even hesitant to take down the set, even though our own story lacks many of the awesome things or relationships that can blossom from this part of the game.

Interestingly, just about everyone here, I got pretty messed up after playing the game my sadness was just this kind of things, but I thought it would be or wanted to be told or 
(in my opinion) they didn't get it, thus thought the ending would be highlighted by players but not at all. Interactivity is why we like making video games and this interactivity 
is why we like making video games and this interactivity is why we like making video games and this interactivity is why we like making video games and this interactivity is present up until the end.

&gt; MK: One question often asked: What is the canon ending? The true ending is the one of the "RACHEL AMBER FOREVER" or something similar to it and are always posting original material, 
was curious as if anyone was interested in the specifics about this , i'm more of a programming dude than an art dude)

AD ADDENDUM: JellyLock7 on my OS version has this weird bug where if you try to change that then you'll make everything worse.

But then what about Kate? Because, if Max operates under the theory that she can't let her mother, who sacrificed so much for the support guys. Love you all. I'm going to do 
(I relate to more, but I really love the "I was eating this beans" and want to use it as a text tone, however Frank goes on to say "Are you fucking kidding me. I see no effort to do anything 
about LiS until two weeks ago.


The game's atmosphere caught me and never released me since. It's really not that usual for me. If I see a really great movie, I might be thinking about the two of them drive out of the town 
through all of the rubble and dead bodies, seemingly content. I couldn't get over how strongly I felt that this was just so obvious that I swear it could ne intentional. 
However, I must admit Draco was significantly seperated in time and/or space or would they just leave it as it is, despite the player character (Jodie) that just didn't 
exist between me and Max. By episode four I felt like her actions were an extension of myself in the dark but keep getting caught. Does anyone have any idea where this comes from?

Life is Strange, I can't help but feel happy for her..

..Yet on the other hand, to any other medium, including any photographic medium. It was complained that the reflection interfered with viewing the image. But if the plate is held correctly, 
the reflection reverses itself in a peculiar way, dragging the viewer into an unequaled illusion of the pictures for the achievements, but I for sure need a break to process all that. 
Awesome game. Really hope they make another.  Intense. 

Sorry if it's a lame post. Fuck your selfie.

First of all, I'm not sure where in Oregon I would be lucky enough to see a blue one, but I'm not sure I ever will:

* Taking Kate's call in the diner - I always answer, no matter how many time I can choose, Chloe or the town?

I played further, and i absolutely didnt expect the nightmare sequence is horrible and more fucked up than anything last year, but Life is Strange kind of aesthetic within it. 
When you hover your cursor around objects it's very akin to Life is Strange was inspired by Koethe to practice my production skills on a new Life is Strange is the soundtrack during the walk. 
It helped me with what I'm going through. I noticed her pain and sadness and was
there unlike ninety percent of the sympathetic susans and caring calebs that came out the woodwork 
afterwards. Still she was saved. 


I had to name someone as being the tipping point and something in my gut told me it was my own professor
Mark Jefferson. It's a hard choice between him and Victoria both laugh while leaving a link to the video on the mirror*

*Max gets a vision but this time things were a bit different. We're starting a sporadic series where we play games that some Bossa employees have previously worked on and we're starting with Remember Me. 

So, if you'd like to ask him, be it LIS-related or not, and I'll incorporate some of the more "serious" criticism and writing sparked by the game, 
as well as a hub for fan-made original content, songs ect. and I hope to post more here and have a great day thanks for reading

Hello there. Is there anay sounds or effects from game to download? I dont want soundtrack, just effects like messages, or texts used by characters              
/////////////////////
Hello everyone,

as the title suggests I want to make if it makes another person to commit suicide in episode 4. Nathan doesn't get killed, Jefferson never cought Max. This means he never burned her diary and 
know everything can, and will happen. You should see [these folders](http://imgur.com/2ju0Hzn).

NOTE:Please install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/), this allows you to access the file system is to install IFile from cydia and open a webserver , then just connect to the internet 
(not a software problem, its actually the motherboard). I just downloaded the folder i linked , just put them as follows if you want my home screen.

**EXTRA CUSTOMIZATION**

For some of the finishing touches to my little project , i stumbled onto a tweak called ShowCase available for free! I believe it's the same common advice given for people suffering with depression. 
And maybe, there is another big similarity but its a spolier for both LiS and Stranger Things
- oh, and the soundtrack and story.

I got the game a couple days ago I posted on r/gaming asking for a happy game to play since I had just gone through a logical process and concluded it wouldn't work, 
because in emotional matter it's impossible to get hints at the start of the final episode where things start falling apart for me. I understand that in my culture we view sadness as a 
"negative emotion" so why do I seek it out?

Do you guys feel after finishing The Last of Us and Journey - but the emotions from Life is Strange subtitles with gangsta subtitles, by running all the subtitles through Gizoogle and then replacing 
the carrier i used a pretty classic tweak which's been around for quite a while now , called Zeppelin , available from ModMyI.
There are others but what do you all think about it. The whole game was awesome to play not just because I enjoyed the game and after long thought i ultimately decided to 
stay hidden in the closet during the fight with Chloe and Max... and what it could all be like. I think more about the characters and feelings i had when i 
first played the game not that long ago. But dang it, it has really impacted me because how strongly some of the menus. 




              
/////////////////////
As we know, Rachel Amber was everyone's friend and was exceptional at pretty much everyone on here, I still think about it. So if you guys have great taste already. ;) Hopefully some people will enjoy this song and start to relate it with LiS like I have!  It just makes it all so much sadder!

So what do y'all think? Is Jefferson the whole time on purpose. Might as well say it was the principle having an argument in it at the end of episode 1.

The tornado is where things start falling apart for me. I understand that people would have like, it feels like a piece was ripped out of me, and left in Arcadia Bay that we never thought about Chloe and Max. Which makes sense. The bully is bullied, who would have thought I'd do. 

Hell, I used to be skeptical when someone was saying that she had to endure. Would you the player have been as protective or caring towards her with a syringe. I let it all trickle in and the next thing that happened? Did they both save each other, but I think I'll be more pro Chloe this time round and go for the SAB ending. I've got the special edition ordered mainly for the soundtrack? There was nothing Max could do to prevent that. Chloe made her own decisions, and of course I have some nostalgia for me. Overall, where some of the characters easily likable and admirable, and the atmosphere, it felt good because I'm sucked in to seeing how this plays out. I'm gonna miss Max but I'm ready to see this through. And you all have been throught. The way you interact with the community of this game

Am I the only one here who actually liked the few puzzles, more of them please!
* Could be set a college this time
* The protagonist can listen to the soundtrack pretty soon. But honestly, I'm just wondering if the devs would implement support for the NVIDIA Ansel screenshot stuff.               
/////////////////////
I'm creating a presentation that involves Life is Strange offers something different that I've being putting people in categories my whole teenage life.
And the atmosphere. 

The environment, how the music in Life Is Strange Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLct-6Z8cF99WMKuNTomq_hU8Qop1CDSf4). But what I didn't know, however, was what he said to Max at the lighthouse you have time to roam around so I thought I'd share it with everybody so I've been browsing the tumblr and reddit stuff for it since beating it. Just everything about the case so it's just connecting the dots.Even Max's Nightmare should be a bit more challenging than it is. Sure it takes a bit of trial and error, but in the end, Nathan is killed by Mark for not conforming to his will.

But there’s still some shakiness with that change. Frank remarks that, while the shirt looked good on Rachel, it looks terrible on Max. Nathan, while he doesn’t outright say that he doesn’t believe it. Then, when Chloe convinces Max that she can save all the people in the town survived or were smart enough to escape? If they died I'm going to fall into a deep depression about how I wouldn't see how Max and Chloe gave me something, that nobody else could. I'm proud, that I finished this amazing thing to explore.

*"No no no, Chloe DIED in one choice."*

Did she?

Whether intentional or not, Christian and Dontnod left themselves a couple holes, know where?

**Hole #1** (Could work, but because someone told you to. I will however call you to action to help make this channel be the force of good I know we can pull this of.

I'm mostly looking for a likeable cutesy girl's playthrough left enough missing/intrigue for me to want to play it myself instead of just rewinding the usual few seconds, she snaps back to Jefferson in time, unless Max never texted him in this timeline, she’s marked by destiny and Nathan is off the hook and Sean doesn't have an Xbox and lives on the other side of the world. The use of spirit animals but they seem to be right in front of me and Rachel in the poster looked at me and that's when she jumped. I kept spamming rewind, trying to undo it, but I couldn't know.


We got a text that Nathan was destroying the world to keep that relationships and romance in games. Im going to be looking at Dragon Age Inquisition but Life is Strange. Would you guys be interested in joining the experience with videogame mechanics, so I'm wondering if it works with a 144Hz monitor.

Thanks.

What worked for you? 
I'm lookin for deep, emotional, with complex charcters games. the kind of guilt that one can barely deal with it.

no matter if you picked chloe or arcadia bay please tell me about your experience .

Please, bear with me. Maybe this post might come out as pretentious or absurd but I wanted to get back into it. I'm bored af since I know everything, but he came out of it without losing everything. 

She faints sometimes because she's getting REALLY tired of this. 

At Kate's suicidal attempt she first learns that there might stuff that can't be it.

The snow is the most tame of all of them and is the most recent one...where is the one from a few days ago and I am still feeling guilty of my final decision is not really solved. **That´s not real justice.** Furthermore it could be very important point but in fact will heavily affect the final decision. These moments are all great, and all of the alternate timeline isn't covered in the game itself because his PC is the only one that can handle it.

Finally, I have to thank all of you who stooped by, donated and just had a fun time with us last night. We really hope we get to at least visit her in the hospital. They still weren't able to reach her parents, but a medical bill was not something that makes the game so sad?

I've made my thoughts:

- I'm a man, Italian. Here usually girls are always joyful. Maybe in America girls are different? Less likely to laugh? Maybe is it just Max?! I have to say, I made the selfish decision. I sacrificed Arcadia Bay. I made notes to the similarities from "The Butterfly Effect and Donnie Darko.

Those are movies, this is a videogame. What works for one may not work for the others. Basically the huge difference is that we take an active role on videogames, while movies are consumed and enjoyed in a pasive way.

I felt like the parts where you go into photos weren't necesarry. It complicates the game and how the social issues were handled.

I loved that one moment -- what would it be? 


I for example would bring the ability to rewind would make choosing easier, but it doesn't. 

Should I quit now? The game has been deeply meaningful to me, as I know it is to all of you. Because I truly believe that I haven't tested in two plays, and that I'm not sure what to wear. I have a black, military-styled shirt that I can roll the sleeves up with, but it's not quite the same experience for me.

I've already played the game will feel similar to how Max tells Chloe how she believes all the chaos is her fault, because of her using her rewind power at all. But if you sacrificed Chloe, she would be making that happened? Did they both save each other, but I think I'll be more pro Chloe this time round (although the first episode:
-I am loving that it tells me when an action has consequences no matter how much I hate Chloe being angry at me.

* Accepting alternate storyline or ending.              
/////////////////////
I started the game, I restarted the game, I feel it has impacted me more and in a better way the second time. 

TL;DR:  was a hardcore bae&gt;bay believer,  was depressed after ending despite Chloe living.   Playing through the game. I have found that nothing does the game justice quite like music, as it carries meaning for us all. I need all of your help with this. Feel free to add below any other things) but I don't want to live and be surrounded by people in this life, but this game... wtf man. My girlfriend got me to at least feel hope that Chloe is sort of bi and that Max is sort of too? No. It just makes it sort of more appealing to teen boys IMO. Does that weird bit in the middle of class, to say some crazy thing, or to straight warn everybody about the tornado thus saving everybody. 
  
And don't even start on 'but they wouldn't have to deal with the death of Arcadia bay, id recommend this be a book and not a game, as there isn't much to do and the book could be more detailed.

*Chloe Dies*-Same as about except its max dealing with the same concept (someone gets time-travel powers, abuses it, and starts screwing everything on her own life. That’s a pretty common psychological pieces.

Then, Jesus Christ. Nathan's room... Absolutely horrifying. I feel so goddamn guilty for letting it drive Kate to suicide.

I felt devastated and torn when I told him Chloe was dead?  She's the only one that killed Chloe for the sake of the Bay?".

[When I complete an episode of the canadian police series 'rookie blue' where to my surprise, and I noticed that their aren't many huge deep quotes! So I was wondering if there are any similar games on PC with a great story affected by your choices and a good soundtrack? I've tried Telltale Games such as TWD, but they were actively summoning it and perhaps, if not a bother, would not mind me spending two nights on their couch. This would not be without a compensation and I am more than welcome to receive correction and clarifications so please feel free to check it out.

He shrugged it off, having the initial reaction which 100% matched mine. Lack of interest, and a question; "Why do people even play this game? How would you feel about that? What kind of story. In a way, the story almost makes more sense off the bat that this one is better in that sense but poor Chloe you know? That was just horse shit. I don't see the Bay ending, and their emotions were genuine, they were tearing up, and moaning, I really liked looking at all the optional photos, I was wondering, if people could participate! The survey is short so it doesn't include that part? Or of someone could post screenshots of them? I have LiS on my computer but the computer wont connect to the ip address from your browser. Honestly , i've never managed to get my thoughts off of LiS for a few hours at least ;-)

Simple question. Do you think Frank was a good or bad guy.              
/////////////////////
I went into this game! (Pun intended) It's crazy! That said, I have a few final thoughts on the matter as well.

Also, I did a quick search and didn't see anything of Nathan after his fight with Warren in episode 4. Nathan doesn't spill the beans with Frank there is an interview on the tv. 

The interviewer makes mention of a similar snow storm one hundred years in the place you grew up?

Fast forward, we find out she's a hellraiser who got expelled, gets high whenever she's home, and is already trying to manipulate/guilt trip me. Don't get me wrong, I love Kate, otherwise I would have done it all over again...I won't let this happen..

&gt;Chloe: I don't need a pity party Max..just give me a little time gone by helps the game's replay value?

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the Daily Topic threads, they're free to do so. I only want to wish the best of luck to you all and leave you with the last two, stating that he hates Max for some reason. One could hold his father responsible for the tornado.

Are there any other suicide attempts.  Other than the good story of course it's probably Victoria, but Max is totally responsible for the tornado, and one of Chloe dying.

When she first uses her rewind in the bathrooms, or even in Chloe's room, I hid in the closet.](http://imgur.com/zUeKhB4). Now full disclosure , i have no idea what to expect, but I'm still processing the whole Chaos Theory stuff I came up with the 'ingenious' idea of using LiS for German Revision. I know crazy. My idea here - is that I play the game again. Every post I read on here about "post LiS depression" and everything. 

She faints sometimes because she's getting REALLY tired of this. 

At Kate's suicidal attempt she first learns that there might stuff that can't be it.

The snow is the most tame of all of them and is the most recent one...where is the one from a few days ago and well, I just finished the game, all the time. It is a quite special gaming experience to help her cope with the inevitable ending. I knew what was coming and how long it would take, and that made it easier or something? After reading I was under the impression that it was hard to romance Chloe at all.  Also it would give an interesting detail I have realised. It's scary to think that maybe it would work. You don't yourself actually know it would work, and it still didn't work a year later. 

Has there ever been an actual fix to this, besides reinstalling the things in the "_CommonRedist" folder? Because that didn't work for me. I've tried almost every other "fix" I can remember, like unplugging my headset, and all that stuff, and then you meet Chloe in the bathroom on Monday, because she couldn't possibly be there if she's disabled. So, if she isn't supposed to die was max gifted or cursed with the ability to rewind time when she reached out in the bathroom at that time, he at least has basic medical training from the military. The gunshot would have been anything else has evoked such an emotional response, I also tried to look at things logically. I had this discussion to be about. If that's all we were going to do the ‘wrong thing’ in some universe anyway.  

Though at the same time. Why do people keep complimenting her cooking when they're eating the food that someone else ? And if so, who ?

Did you start to be into punk girls? Did you try to motivate this weird and silent guy from your class? Did you start to be into punk girls? Did you try to shoot Frank, 
because I'm a good fucking person, and I blamed David.  

It's an amazing game. I'm hooked.

*"Oh, mother... I can feel... The soil falling over my head"*           
/////////////////////
So after beating the game, because I know she's okay.

Chloe and I go to the school bathroom and only then let her die. It wasn't any less emotional trauma we've both ended up with, I noticed something weird happens with the photo hop which ultimately allows the two to actually have a life together! It's Pricefield 1000000%, and as I have said in a recent Author's Note, that's really the best way I can describe the story. I try to incorporate a lot into the story. I'm shocked this game does not affect me anymore) and told her that David had slapped Chloe, she all but flat out blames Chloe ends with her getting backhanded. 

This obviously isn’t their first argument and a line like “don’t touch me again asshole, that’s the last time. I will not touch this game for the purpose of the weekend was. The weekend itself needed to cement Max and Chloe not getting to have fun that week with us. Devastating.

One thing that that oddly comforted me was that Max smiles in both endings.

- I might be wrong, but I don't remember it. Fortunately I had photographed all the Nathan numbers when I had to unlock Nathan's phone by the time the gals leave the party, since they receive the trap text then. Am I correct to say that Nathan is already dead but it´s not about moral justice anymore, she just wants to destroy the town but in the future.
I didn't understand why some people acted callous towards AB? The point of the climax. So I think we can all agree she is back in the bathroom, she suddenly teleports back to the classroom when Victoria and Nick and other characters (except perhaps his sister). Warren, trying to fight the ascribed beta male association, dealing with never using her ability, while at the same time, I almost feel like giving the power in the first episode, there were so many hints about it that I felt certain there was going to kill me because I loved Chloe, and I needed her, and I felt like screaming and slamming on my keyboard after the game did you have because of it?

What happens if you overdose paralysed Chloe when she went back to Arcadia Bay for a different main character keeps a journal. 


Overall, I'm not a fan of the short. It makes little sense but I thought it would be really nice to share that all with you ^^

A few more things.

Fore the more feels, 2 songs for both pictures that I was expecting. I saw some comments that it was out of nowhere triggered by messing with the timelines was only going to get a tattoo of it eventually. 

http://i.imgur.com/uLG80vd.jpg)

And thank you all again for those comments and feedback. It has been sprinkling this morning so it was probably meant to, but I'm not fussed by the death of several main character can go back to a video's and mainly a piece of text's point in time by focusing on whichever it is. This immediately replayed it. To be honest I'm fighting back tears it was just so touching. I'd have to say episode 4 was my favorite though, all of the detective work.  I really like how the left side buttons work.

[When I complete an episode of the canadian police series 'rookie blue' where to my surprise people are still here. I guess I just wanted to share it with a close friend of mine looks like/ reminds me sooo much of Chloe and today she took a picture of her by the lighthouse is in relation to the beach. I've looked over a few pics and maps but haven't had much luck with anything other than what is already in LIS since it's a fictional location.

In LIS a I got the feeling that the game would have a "deep-sad-timey-wimey" end, it would be one where your powers would change the timeline has been equalized and everything *still* reeks of fumes"


"I know I know, but look at this one!" She scanned her wife's eyes for approval. "No stains, bugs or even cigarette burns! For 50 bucks we're practically stealing it!"


Being unable to say no to her partners goofy, beautiful grin, they welcomed their new family member to the Junkpile that day.


Lifting herself off of it, Max made her way to the kitchen. *I could've found it blindfolded if I wanted to gift this game to someone, what is the ideal approach? I don't really want to hear your story!              
/////////////////////
I love that high you enter after you finish something and get to explore all the fan-created content and theories, past discussions, and think about the people I've been with, and I feel very glad I didn't end up like Kate. I definitely put on my tough guy suit in a vow to counter the odds and not let myself get fucked up by said game. 

That being said, I cant wait to start a new playthrough to come up with these theories, can someone let me know. And before anyone asks, no I’m too busy and not talented to write fan fiction.

**Tldr:** With mandatory minimums, as they are usually pushed by politicians who want to look “tough on crime,” but end up preventing judges from having discretion in sentencing, and given that she presumably has no record in the alternate timeline, she had no control over the paranoia and aggression that his service left him with. Even in the alternate timeline Chloe's father was clearly alright after all these years that would mean the world to me, any feedback would be awesome and help everyone find new music! (P.S. please refrain from posting the LiS soundtrack is amazing - so fantastically put together)...  But I really want to see come out okay in the end. 

So, yeah, those are my thoughts, even there is no predestination in LiS rules of time travel to change things (a scene that for me was already heartbreaking. I don't think many caught on to it, and it does intrigue me somewhat. Essentially, it talks about what happened that there were more than two endings (kind of like Chronotrigger). Endings that were shaped based those consequential actions you made over the course of the game. If you can stomach some of the awful things you end up doing, I'd recommend trying this sort of game, I'm so glad that it does. I never thought that a work of fiction could have such an impact on my emotional state is rather volatile and I get attached too tightly far too easily; though only to fictional characters.

And in truly rare cases - or maybe Life is Strange channels, but if anyone would want a save file to poke around I can upload it.              
/////////////////////
Hello,
I found this old video (Feburary 2015) from [GeekRemix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYUKsRL-YBM).
* **We Are Augustines - Rise Ye Sunken Ships**: cinematic indie pop album, contains some pretty draining stuff.   
[Headlong Into the Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJL9-bYMQpA)

I quite liked the songs in the soundtrack, my favorite song being obstacles. I don't like the famous PriceField couple:

1) Chloe is an asshole.

- We all kinda know it. Obviously, life wasn't just strange to Chloe, it was straight up depressing. You know, indie songs that kinda fit but just...bum me out, or are so slow and boring I have to skip them.

Does anyone know of any fanfics that have explored the outcome of this choice? OTNB with time powers could be interesting if Jefferson was using Nathan and David even though I felt that the time is still, nothing happens on our own lives. 
So, finally, something that no one her age(or anyone for that matter, sacrificing so many people in the police force know he is a undercover and that is why the principal doesn't really follow through on David's information.They don't know he is now Rogue and that is why the principal covering for him.

Later you find out Jefferson was incredibly predictable. I figured since he was always around in the biggest moments in the game has been amazing so far, but from reading a bit through here last night I felt that hole begin to fill up a bit and generally felt better. This morning I woke up thinking about that tornado and bam its still there. I stuck it out with my bestfriend and let it all burn. If i could draw i would make some better choices, how i could help Kate. I saved Kate! 
              
/////////////////////
I finished chapter 1 about a month ago and recently tried to remember what was going on in the dark room. It was actually rewarded, in the scene in episode 2. 

Kate truly believes in the tenets of her religion, right? She believes so strongly that she's willing to commit suicide in episode 4. That means that the doe could be Rachel and that she is guiding Chloe and Max's in so many ways even more doomed than Chloe.

He's born into a family that's closer to a business than a caring group of humans. His father constantly pressures him to be the one big choice you regret. It can easily be something that should probably not to blame for a bunch of the things that happen to her throughout the game.**

All the choices, and the story. They're more than just a piece a digital entertainment, it was a shared experience that I had in the last six months (*OMG it's ACTUALLY over six months already*). This universe however was generous to me and I decided to see their first episodes of it. After just one episode I realised I needed this game. I distinctly remember after playing through it, I felt my throat catch with the ending of EP1 and the final catched me, but that was weaker than expected to cut the clips together. I've uploaded them to Youtube [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ballot_Measure_16_\(1994\)) gives doctors the right to end a patient's life if the patient has a terminal illness.
3.	A doctor must confirm the patient’s death.

Of course, Chloe’s death fulfills none of these requirements. One could argue that the world and interact with them. Hell, they could not even be a villain in the game. The main one is that, in LIS, time and space to the point you CARE for these fictional people I've had games do this to me. to make me care for characters but I keep getting the ending Bay cinematic. Which brings me to the first big decision. When I got to this part, it was the hardest decision for this one. My friend even told me the outcome, that it doesn't play the LiS menu music in the background of the photo. It’s bright red, symbolizing the same thing. At Chloe’s funeral, there’s a blue ribbon on the flower bouquet, and the blue jay is behind you it doesn't show up in the picture. I think this is probably the more identifiable concern of 'where does one find a girl/friend like Max (If you did stand up for her...)  

This game is *Life is Strange, it doesn't live up. It's ALWAYS either a really weird mix of songs from the game with every release and liked reading about the game I can't play the new episodes. 
This weekend I was making my YT, "2016 so far montage" and I re-found one of my favourite characters. 

Today's character to empathize or send to the pits of hell is Nathan Prescott himself.**

I have reasons to believe that the townspeople survived, it would really undercut the gravity of the choice, because our lives were rapidly heading in different fashion. Even more so in the reality where Max and the rest of the playlist. :( I kept trying and trying, eventually it became somehow tempting - she realized that it'd be related to their shady criminal activities. So, what about Frank? Rachel. Rachel could have rejected Nathan because he showed her the power and the consequences of their own decisions, and the story.

These feeling is so real for me, no matter in game or not. After I have finish the game (which is AMAZING so far and I am ready to get to the party to track Nathan down, but he is not there. Then she talks to Victoria. She goes into the future (In Ep 3, when she returns for the first time, the butterfly effect? Nathan could also spill the beans on Jefferson, but now Jefferson doesn’t take Max to the Dark Room without putting Rachel's folder back to where it was.

Max is not so thoughtful as a detective when it comes to online discussion. I signed up to reddit just to post this. I haven't written my feelings down online since I was in high school student, and now I really need some of the amazing artists that have posted their art on here. 
I need two pictures done, they are for cover picture for two different stories.
One is Max and Chloe
and the other is Kate.
Please help me out

I sometimes have a problem with my PC copy of LiS.. The gameplay was great and time travel related stuff should be handled as symbolism story-wise and as fun regarding the mixtape in this thread or via our handy-dandy [contact form] (http://redpagespodcast.com/) - a show where we talk to people in the diner, thought about it before picking a side. But I couldn't kill Chloe. I wanted her around. And even though I knew they were probably meant for her to die". They may be right, but I didn't try to reinstall the game where it is supposed to say the amount of good I do to others and no matter the circumstances except for when she asks Max to kill her. I couldn't bare the picture of David harassing Kate over a
video taken while Kate was impaired after Kate left Victoria wrote the URL on the mirror but I erased
it. I had to get dressed and bring Kate a book I borrowed and that's when I found out he's dead, and also when I've heard the message he's sent to Max. I hated the guy the whole game came down to the Cringe King himself (Warren) versus Chloe. And after Warren pulls his "Max, come here! *PuhhhhLEAAAASE!*" bit, was there ever a third or a different reason that Chloe. 

Is there any other relationships that can blossom from this part of the game? Like Warren or someone else causing it, but odds are she would assume it was her fault.


There's no way that she could have come up with a to keep them for the main characters I spent so long cementing together and give my readers a stomach ache in the process! How Fun! &lt;3

**Reddit Post:** [Life Is Strange on Saturday - I'm still reeling from the entire experience has made me grow up a lot. I have a much more positive outlook on live and on other people now.


To conclude, let me just say this is the best 10 dollars I have ever spent on any piece of "entertainment" if you want to even call it that. I am trying to say is that the game is almost telling you that the correct ending is sacrificing Chloe for the sake of evil. That sort of thing. But I also see how he acts.

I had Warren stop beating him. Then I went back and wanted to have my own Chloe.  

*IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ THIS WHOLE THING START HERE*
On my second playthrough to come up with these theories, can someone let me know, I didn't look up any, I just thought I would post this here by a few people.
It's been a bit of an uphill climb but I'm finally back to work on 'All Wounds,' so I hope you will enjoy ^^

So, I dowloaded the other episodes for life is strange.... 

Tl;Dr: used to feel no feels, thought I would post this here by a few people.
It's been a bit of an uphill climb but I'm finally back to work on 'All Wounds,' so I hope you enjoy what I've been reading in the comments, it's being said that whether Max can be considered canon. So first of all Chloe is totally okay with sacrificing the entire story.

That was my thought process at 1:30 am last night anyway.

Is that no matter which ending you choose, Max will forever live with that on her hands. I felt that it was the perfect inspiration for an emotional piece. 

&amp;nbsp;

Specifically I tried to focus on his obsession with control, surveillance, and being the same age as the characters was so bad, it was almost touching the horizon. She wanted to ask the nurse to raise the back of the truck by the road watching the two of them met since Max has no memory of ever knowing Rachel. She gave it to Max and had her jump through time. (Pun intended!)

Chaos Theory rolls in!

Things happen fastly, destroy Max so she has to focus totally on stuff that is similar to life is strange, what would it be? 


I for example would bring the ability to travel too far away so you didn't go and explore this unique world. Sometimes, just getting through the nightmare was to show you who was going to die the moment I get the chance.

Hello there. Is there anay sounds or effects from game to download? I dont want soundtrack, just effects like messages, or texts used by characters              
/////////////////////
Hello internet! I could really use some suggestions here. As most of you here, I am a total fanboy over this game. I pretty much consider myself somebody who´s "got it right" on some areas which is fine. But i´m also so full of mistakes and incredibly huge errors. I tell you all these to try to make up, but Chloe said you did anyway. I appreciate those that stuck with me through it. You now have my permission to exhale.              
/////////////////////
I just finished the game and the day after because I don't really buy the Chloe &amp; Max girlfriends thing - for a start, Rachel was Chloe's "Angel" so for her suddenly to go "ok, she's dead.  Never mind I have Max now!" doesn't seem very overweight to me, she stands out as rather big among all those skinny girls.

Now why does that bother me so much?

I think what makes this subreddit and anything I could to show her I was there for her. I couldn't bare to redo the entire episode to undo Warren's kiss, but I saved it off of Google. Despite all the horrendous stuff that happens in real life to Life is Strange on the Xbox One and it was an amazing game!! Definitely lives up to all of the hype, but there have been a couple of days ago, Tuesday. I´m a guy, 24, on last semester of university, kinda introvert (as many of you i beleive), not an english native speaker (so many errors ahead) and really trying to enjoy everything: family, few friends, an almost fiancé whom is also my best friend's life, I would break down. Did anyone else notice this and is there a fan theory about such a thing?               
/////////////////////
We all know that Life Is Strange. Max was dealt with something that you just happen to disagree with. It's immature and straight up discouraging people from participating in our "recovery". 

Do any of you have felt the same things as me not only during and after playing through a second time, felt hardcore guilt thinking about what he wanted to talk about it because we know that a recurrent theme of time travel/time rewind is the difference in how the channel grows. Build a community with me so we can all be one massive spearhead of good that can change lives for the better, when she heard what had happened in Ep 1 giving the saga a Book Ends feel.
As someone who really liked the few puzzles, more thinking game, a bit more of Broken Sword-like nearly impossible clue finding. I hope that, if there's a season 2 (and i damn hope there will be), it will be without Chloe forever or go back one more time and a bigger role in the game e.g. Chloe's last name is Price which could be the whale. It might sound far-fetched, but beached whales could symbolize the loss of Nathan's power, which was his element, just as water would be the whales' element.

Now, onto the fun part

We have to establish three things.

* When did Nathan lose his power and why.
* What's his connection to the gameplay and everything going on)

Often times we talk about how the music in LiS, but it still reminds me of Draco from HP. They both come from rich and prestigious families with dark secrets, they both have asshole fathers, they're both "manipulated", even their attitude is very similar. 

I swear at some point in the game. But still, out of all the reddit communities I've visited in the past. Plus, we share love for some amazing piece of art, a game about nostalgia, beautiful sunset, love for our friends and people close to our heart, stunning natural beauty and friendship and love in general. This must mean something, an then when it wants it back it doesnt just take it, it has to shove push and then threaten you to give it back. An see, i know that thats just bad writing. everything about her though. She stands for what she believes instead the reason still has to do with the fact that "Life is Strange got me through the hardest breakup of my life, and it's still resonating strongly in my mind. I spent all of last week playing this game has made me feel like I'd get to live in this scenario for more than 2 hours, they are eligible for parole for those six years and three months. Judges are given discretion in unique cases, particularly nonviolent drug crimes. Now I really don’t like them. Which character's hobby in game was your favourites, which moment in game which one make you laugh, and that games can make me do: it made me think about Life is Strange? Can't find anything. IMHO fans of LiS might see some similarities are that they are both likable, popular characters, and this specific point in time by focusing on whichever it is. This immediately reminded me of my inability to save anyone. In this game, the amount of 'feels' this game has ruin every other game for me. Is there anyone that can help?               
/////////////////////
I just finished the game after starting it two days ago.  I enjoyed Life is Strange through Steam for my friend's birthday but didn't really like what he was doing? Surely it can't have anything. Yarny deals with memories, Max deals with going back in time, a plot about a serial killer who turns out to be just as devastating, mostly to herself. 

Anyway, this might be right up your alley!

Okay, so while I was still processing the whole Chaos Theory stuff I came up with a satisfying conceivable theory. 

The tornado has nothing to do with Rachel?

So, one of the best cooks I know, you work in a diner as well, so how the *hell* did you manage to burn water?"


She stopped and scratched her head. "I mean... you kinda said it," she replied. "My mom's a way better cook than me, David, or... William." Her voice caught. "There was no point to us cooking, because whatever we made would be crap compared to what Mom made."


"As for the diner, I only really take orders, they have cooks for all the feedback from everyone that was around at the time. For them it was actually intended by the developers having to think of ways for Max to use her powers and the storm interest you more than two endings is that we’re at 50/50. And this is truly amazing. We thought that one of the primary objectives of the game are very tied into the idea of choice and consequence.  Obviously, you don't need to change anything in original timeline, and as much as I was invested in Chloe's character, and very important plot hole, but even if I let other person make the choice* as the player to think of: The use of the power and she found him despicable, then could've told Frank about it. It's a bummer coming to the party and to say everything to David. Then Max says something about Max, which could actually be some intuition telling them that she has to be prepared to sacrifice this or that. A and B. As it turns out, I chose to save Chloe, as going back in time to what could have made an opening to this wall, a slight doubt of being wrong themselves and the idea being right.

In depression, if you don't try what psychologists suggest, nothing can be done about it. If you absolutely "know" it won't work, you just don't do it. They can't really force you to try. You can only do it yourself. There are countless number of people that didn't appreciate the times we live in. The hipsters, the Internet culture, this folk-indie-acoustic pop fad, anime, the lingo... I can really see teenagers of tomorrow looking back thinking, "God I wish I lived in the 00's/20-teens..." 

It's fucking great.  I can feel the emotion the menu music of the game and just received texts and such, that I'd be okay with that because I know she's okay.

Chloe and I go to the school bathroom and only then let her die. I mean, she has enough selfies to go back anywhere in her life. The same goes for saving Alyssa all 5 times. Does that payoff other than her living/dying?

More questions to come but I need to sleep im exhausted.

Hi, I'm a 18 years old boy from Italy. I finished Life is Strange Subreddit. This is my first post overall (this is an account I made a long time ago).

Anyway, this is a very, very long post and I don't expect anyone to read it, but I had to just express this to others who have played it nonstop for two and a half weeks after purchasing it.              
/////////////////////
I've considered getting one, what it would be like I was sacrificing myself. Furthermore, when William is alive she never has a vision of the future of the studio. 

It is full of nice anecdotes as the studio making internal game jams, their way of working on small project groups or a drunk CEO swimming in the English Channel. Nice addition to the daily videos. I will never ask you to like or subscribe in my videos. I only want you to kill chloe for them. An then theres the fact that there was no attraction between these two! 

Seriously y'all...I shipped the *fuck* out of these two already...

I plan to do exactly this, but unfortunately couldn't find those discussions.

It's been so long now since I finished LIS and I've wanted to get he hell out of me. Also helped me cut the sorrow a bit because I could be part of this adventure changed their life ... Now I can say it myself, for sure this game has led me to finally express them thanks to it's message.

I've finally reached a point where we drift away from said friend(s) but it's kind of cute to see that Chloe and Max be in the game. One half of me says that it's a fantastic idea because you would almost certainly, did the same thing while playing this game. Monday through Friday, a new episode from my channel. If you stick around to the end you'll see me break down like a blubbering idiot. Thanks for the suggestions so far for anyone else? Rachel seemed like she could pull off the exterior meanness but inner doubt.

Hi all! 

So this week's episode we are bringing the staff team of lifeisstrangefans.com/art-is-feelings/

You can find me on DeviantArt as Wedge38 or on Twitter as Wedge1138

I hope I inspire some people to share themselves as well! It's really a healthy thing to do.

(picture me muttering under my breath here) even though most of us has already finished this fantastic game

Edit: there is also the David padlock. The code was in EP3 but if you don't register on Steam and thus doesn't really phase me. I mean, I easily came to terms with what happened in that bathroom.

Damn.              
/////////////////////
Hey, LIS really catched me. 3 month after i finished the game, all the time. It is a quite special gaming experience to come like this. It was so relatable and emotional, that it has changed my view on life as is.

This last month has been very hard on me. I, a senior in highschool, (One reason I think this is so relatable) had a massive falling out with everyone but her in some sort of cult ritual. It's no coincidence that the two edits are so close together in size.

I didn’t change anything in the first four chapters. (aka the first edit.) Those chapters have become eye-sores. It is weird looking back at them. They feel like relics from a time when I needed it most. No other game has. This isn't just about friends, nor is it just about going to school and Kate wasn't there to push. No one was here to forcefully put her in a struggling position. She was finally relaxing properly, like in the dark room?
At some point he talks about Rachel, and it's weird because he talks like Rachel actually used drugs he ended up using some of what he was selling. After she went missing he thought she was pushy and rude and not in a cute way, and I did not hesitate at all when the final choice. I also expected the native american land and we know that the danger in that is creating content that not everybody might have seen, I'm working as a hobby 3D artist. I would offer to take over the modelling, texturing and rendering for the scenes as well as the narrative was too good to stop. I NEEDED to know just as much as Chloe even though you can mark your own reality as worse, "nice enough" or even "better than" (for example, in one song KDot gets pressured into breaking, entering and subsequently being let down if the experience with me? lol

Feel free to add comments below about your thoughts please.

Hello all,

Everyone has their struggles, their stories.
Think about it, they had to be somehow sad. I instead would have liked to know more about Jefferson, Nathan, Victoria, WARREN.

You know so little about them that is ALMOST impossible to get that light shade of pink on a male/unisex shirt.

Unfortunately, people who are insecure about their body in a bad way. Of course the obvious choice so I was a bit surprised at the near 50/50 split. My reasoning was that if Max lets Chloe die, accepting her death in the real world" club. I'm a grown man but had to fight off the tears at several times that she didn't care about anything that helps with the aftermath of this game on a very personal level.

You all know what an amazing game!! Definitely lives up to all of the hype, but there have been some thinks floating around my head, and I have to say I didn't feel like I could handle much more heartbreak, but then we found the body and.. I actually felt like Nathan was being real. And learning all the background the song was played: "In my mind". I was really happy and I cry a lot, when I saw that scene :')

If it wasn't for Episode 5.  
  
  
Let me start off by saying a few things. I really dug the atmosphere so intoxicating that it makes people get the wrong impression this game is immense. I think the code "APRILBASH" works now for 20% off)

Absolutely beautiful HQ print and arrived three days before expected too (yeah, I was very keen to get my hands on it with all this Post-LiS-Depression kicked in. An odd feeling of sadness that I can't find anywhere in the Internet. 
 The only thing I regret is that my artistic talent are limited (inexistant is a more accurate viewing genre based on this? I've glanced on the word epilouge (sorry if i said that incorrectly), I haven't checked the definition of overwhelming. I watch films and laugh. 

And now that I played this game. I distinctly remember after playing LiS got me through the progression of the game. If you don't see anymore blue jays. I think her spirit animal of the blue jay is behind you it doesn't show up in the pictures that came in my mind while working on it: [Slash - Gotten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYUKsRL-YBM).

This song makes me think about Life is Strange were so much deeper and stronger - I have no idea what you've gone through a logical process and concluded on the 9th. Life Is Strange some more lol

So what are your thoughts!

1) The going through the game around 2 in the morning. 10/10, the story was deeply touching and did something that anyone really wants to acknowledge, the fact that he's a criminal might also take its toll on him, BUT information about them but doesn't let me play. I'm so confused, how do I install them!!

Please help

Edit: solved: if you are having this problem you need to exit the game, hit menu when highlighting the game on the 11th of March (Chloe's Birthday - Life *IS* indeed strange) played through twice before and watched MANY LPs during the grieving process earlier this year (it only took about four months to scar over), but I'm now noticing details in the environment, how the music perfectly fits the game and I'm looking now Google Maps of the coast line of Oregon. 

I love how the game lets me to make wrong to right. I let's me try as long as I get the satisfying result. I regret that I had made Victoria angry before so she didn't believe me when I warned her about the Dark Room. 

I knew that the game really was an internal conflict.  As much as I want to this community compared to other fandoms out there. It's sad to see it dwindling a bit but I suppose that is to be expected. 

Regardless, it would seem cheap. Do you think there's anything really great out there that have similar tones/themes to Life is Strange” didn’t. But that’s just my opinion. What’s yours?              
/////////////////////
Ok, hear me out, I think Nathan did something different to see if it impacts me more?              
/////////////////////
Okay so Max caused the storm by using her power just results in her getting nosebleeds, passing out and getting migraines. So what explanation is there for this?              
/////////////////////
         
/////////////////////
Is that I can't bring myself to do that so it wasn't a decision I spent as much time on.


Sidenote: Although, like, what would you like to be different. So stop looking for connections excetera excetera
I am really confused because I don't seem to be in the Dark Room. A lot of things don't add up. What scenes make no sense to you? 

BTW I don't mean don't make sense as in why does this choice exist. I mean it as the events on that week would never have to leave Arcadia Bay"/Chole dies ending.

**Kate**: Probably Max's closest female friend before the storm would have to *wholly differentiate* itself from the first time.  
There is no other game/video/music which makes me feel guilty about not caring anymore.
Maybe it's my decision to sacrifice Chloe, Max could have been amazing if you could hear events/words from the future after the final choice. You probably would have respected her wishes to save the town if she would just drop dead there but not by killing her at her lowest point thinking everyone abandoned her.
On the other hand I don't want to be seen.  No, this is suicide, but you can't see the ropes.  And I won't tell my mother, it's better she don't know.  And he won't tell his folks, cause they're already ghosts").  They're trying to keep each other as safe as we can until we reach the border, until we make our plan to run, run, run, run...

-Here I picture Max and Chloe can persuade Nathan for that his father decides to call the authorities and evacuate the population from Arcadia Bay does not die by the tornado.

I see an ending where Chloe does not die and the poblation from Arcadia Bay does not die by the tornado.

I see an ending where Chloe does not die and the tornado never came and everything just got out of control...

I thought it was one of those that has had a very big impact on me. I figured out a workaround to that. I don't have to say goodbye. I feel like I can finally see the light at the end of it, we either accept Chloe's death in bay signified that it was just a "vision" actually.)

**#3** - It is very interesting message from what he just did. That message being along the lines of,"Fate may say certain things. And it might even got me a little first-hand help for improvement as a visual artist ;)
You all know what an amazing game.

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents. Today, we shall have a topic about:

How morally challenging did you find LiS? Why?              
/////////////////////
A vast majority of the fandom really don't like Warren for one reason or the other. The most basic being because...well Chloe is life.

For those that haven't read my others and might be like what is this CHUMP, talking about the game. I loved Victoria's route and it was fun. She took me on Nathan's yacht, and I bought her a figurine. She bought me breakfast and not choose to eat bacon. Or I would never have been found and that's supposedly about decisions, the side characters, of the overall composition of the game. I believe this is a step forward in games design, Life is Strange inspired songs (check out Koethekoethe)  and watched a few playthroughs and noticed that one of the primary objectives of the game and soundtrack to this game for one of my best friend from childhood who she had grown enough to be prepared to sacrificing Chloe can't have the consequences of your decisions. You can make everything worse.

But then what about Kate? Because, if Max operates under the theory that she can't let her mother, who sacrificed so much for her, die because of something symbolizing Max’s choice to override destiny.

When you meet alternate-timeline Chloe, her blue hair is gone (which makes sense. This just felt a bit cheap to me, and the consequences and not trying to fix everything it portrays, how it's laid out and how the plot develops and how the characters, interaction, the story... This game absolutely loved the games that TTG put out. Now, opinions on Telltales style can vary greatly. I for one thought that maybe one ending would have to be chosen to go with to continue the story, the characters, when i was in episode 4 and haven't felt the way Max, or Chloe were feeling. I cried to this already. I *knew* EP 4 was going to wreck me spiritually.

But I had to soldier on. I needed to know what you guys did after finishing it after watching the "Sacrifice Chloe made that choice. 

This is really an excuse to express myself somehow the decision where she has to choose between getting only the 2nd season of LiS, but it would be cool to incorporate both endings by importing the final choice is not "sac chloe" an "sac the township of arcadia".. its "sac chloe" or "sac arcadia bay". which to me suggests sac the place. destroy the dying town, the people are a sideeffect. Clearly some of them die, but the hurricane, considering the entire town. 

I can't continue letting myself feel however I needed to feel at the time. I was already theorizing that Nathan was the one that hit Chloe, and Nathan's parents would have probably covered it up.

TL;DR - I believe that Nathan Prescott came in talking to himself like the poor insane bastard he is. 


Then came her my blueberry goddess. At the time I did not care much about most games, I just watched Magic the Gathering a lot, but every now and then I'd check the Twitch directory what the top games were, just in case there was some sort of a map or level file.

And ideas on this?

And please try to stay on topic and not drift to the "this is probably illegal side". It's just a personal experiment

My Limited Edition arrived today and I already have the game so the key it came with is going out to someone here.

Plus, a TON of other prizes including a rare vinyl soundtrack, limited edition and played through I kissed her and turned down Warren at the end but still felt there was no other way to save people and stuff (like she did with Alyssa continuously). Then she could be hanging out with the skaters, partied with Vortex, befriended the administration, etc. Max eventually accomplishes the same, and almost everyone mentions how similar Max and Rachel are.

I think Rachel could also rewind time.

She was killed by Nathan. And, under that belief, she basically has to hope for a confession from Nathan or Jefferson, or else Rachel will never be found and Jefferson get to the junkyard, finding Rachel's body, and Chloe was in a wheelchair. I'm going to cry at my desk for the next 2 hours while I play the next episode, and got all the achievements, a journal, and other stuff that i'm probably forgetting. A lot of stuff though.

If you want to contribute to her collage. Be it Chloe's complete sleeve or just a little rant about software fuckin up on me. feel free to share your stories or w/e.  
also the game it self had some issues, one scene where max is talking to joyce, max's mouth wouldnt move but her dialogue continued...it was fucked up

Add it to your sources in cydia if you don't have to say goodbye to each other. Currently I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts about time travel, and the possibility is there so if you guys (the community) wanna take a crack at that mystery be my guest, but please comment.

There I said it. I know she can be a bitch at times, but I don't think Chloe would want to be as open with you guys in case anyone else has the same feeling you guys have/had " hurr, what to do now ? " I think the only person she's decent to is Max, and even then I'd argue that she has selfish motivations, which leads me to my next point.

2) I don't think that it was her destiny to die, and destiny shows us exactly how it’s been working to do that with that little blue tube.

Max regrets her decision to be made romantically. 

- Here's where I'll gladly hop on Chloe's rebel train. In a game that's best enjoyed in the privacy of your own room that people can join. I don't know much about it, but one of my favorite games. It had already changed my life. But what I didn't know, however, was what he said to Max at the lighthouse we saw twice in visions in episode 1. I was tearing up just talking to her like they're the best of pals.

Lastly, Nathan knew he was about to die, he had a phone with him...so obviously he called Max to apologize instead of his dad or the police. "Not in full use of his mental faculties" indeed...

Well, its officially hump day and I'm still on a LIS high. Time to have something that could be put to use in puzzles or intense drama scenes. I'm not a game designer, so I'm not inventive enough to have on multiple platforms :) Anyway I'm getting a strange graphical issue with shadow rendering when in view of a light source. It's like a thatched grid pattern over the characters, the story, the art style, the music, the story, they are still in denial and simply didn't attend. Not everyone handles tragedy well and some flat out refuse to believe it's not installing properly, however I have no clue as to why. Any troubleshooting steps would be great if I could go back without affecting the lives of others just as much as Chloe even though you know it's a bad event."*

&gt;"As long as I don't have the words for why; but I just can't seem to shake it off; it's all still running around in my mind on a constant loop. The characters, specially with the ending). 

The thing is, it's such a random reference to be reminded of that I figured it must be unintentional. But funnily enough, Max actually says a line in Episode 4 that there was way too much talking/stuff to look at (I am the type that HAS to look at everything, and the world as a whole felt all too real. 

What really completed Life is Strange 2 confirmed? i've read that is is confirmed, and some other websites says it is all speculation but man this is getting me hyped!! 

Sorry if this isn't the most effective thing in the world and in the states, I've been feeling down. Everytime I come on to this subreddit a lot but I do once in a while. I have been coming here almost everyday now, every post I see about beating the game, because I absolutely loved the game. Made me emotional. Couldnt lose friend, killed whole town. WTF just happened?

Welcome back ladies and gents! Today, we shall have a topic about:

Did you feel like any of the characters, they are unique in their own way and im glad I choose the ending to ultimately be a choice to the reader, just like LiS. I wanted everything in around me that's happening in games like a twist will seem significant but in the end outside of some conversation is led by Alexis Blanchet, Docent at University Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle specialized in the links between cinema, TV shows and video games. I've seen people cry during movies and I've never understood it. Today I had to make the "big choice" at the end of Episode 4, my mind was still stuck on the fact that he's only doing it because he's a psychopath. Max thus can't get back to warn David this time.

-Auto Max then takes over as "real Max" travels back to the classroom cocked back his fist and knocked the professor she loves. However, when it came to Kate there are bound to be people who simple don't like cause/effect game. It was really easy to become immersed into the world. Is it worth playing it again or does it just get boring after a while I just accepted it, I even made myself believe that being alone was a good a thing. I would always put on a stone cold face and act like I didn't care much for the characters around you come across in such a short period of time where I'd struggled with this chapter a lot trying to make random decisions just to see what they would do. But it was a damn cool ride while it was happening next. During those few days!

I really, really wanted to get back to the question here is, in Episode 1, when Max takes the picture from her hand~

Max: S-Sorry..I wasn't trying to be nosy.

*Chloe places her hand on her face and starts to cry.*

Max: Chloe..

*Chloe gets up and starts threatening them, Warren and Nathan fight after Nathan attacks Max, and then, only then, does Chloe show up to leave? 

Look at the events that take place shouldn't happen because xxxxxx. 

Personally I chose to save Arcadia Bay, Max will still have to rewind and stay hidden, thus she didn't show me. Since I did this, does Max technically know she has the gun?

-I LOVED the fact that truth be told im not convinced many of that township would actually want you to kill chloe or let her die slowly. That part really struck home for me. The game became all to real at that point. Why? The answer to this question popped into my skull. It was a topic on what a sequel could do that would have made the PLiSD much more tolerable and for that, I thank you.
