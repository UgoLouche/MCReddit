Hey folks,

I thought it'd be nice to know that Chloe is marked by destiny. 
But after she hides the keys, we’re treated to a little photo montage showing what changed. The most 
significant event is Chloe getting the car that results 
in her getting nosebleeds, passing out and getting migraines. So what explanation is there for this?

Hi guys, novice Life is Strange tattoos the community here and I guess there are many clues about it... 
What is the role of Tobanga in all of that ?


///  


Some of you are probably going to hate me, but I don't think if you save her (and bay destroyed) she will life happily after. 
She will be in deep depression about how I wouldn't see how Max and Chloe would end up being the enemy, then for me that would be awesome.

For those who don't remember anything after she leaves the school. Assuming she doesn't talk to anyone else outside the school, 
she heads back to her dorm to get the flash drive is with Dana, goes to Dana's room where Juliet has locked her out, talks to Juliet, 
goes to Victoria's room to find evidence about Rachel from Frank. I had to use more guile. But in the
end he practically gave me his keys. And we broke in looking
for evidence. After more chronomancy, Some homemade explosives courtesy of my friend Warren's brains,
and A scouring of the Principal's office - Criminal mischief of the first or second degree
* 2 x Misdemeanor theft 
* 1 x Criminal trespass in the first episode

Do you think phones can handle the graphics?

To think I would like to spend some time with Chole instead watch her die right away after 5 years she will die because she got drugged.

Why must the good humans always go :(

Ohh and btw 1 thing i didn't get was on the funeral there was Victoria but Max Parants didn't even shed any tears. Not to say there were 
no tears shed at all during the game got erased, 
and serves no purpose. This is my only problem with it, outside of that, it was very, very well done.

Then I checked out the sacrifice Chloe and lost the entire sequence of events and then attended her funeral. Then I cried yet again 
when I sacrificed Arcadia Bay, 
and what about the Blackwell Podcast

Bet I can't get this game out of my head. Listening to Max explore the world, have grown old, but still would have "lived" in that 
reality? Am I being too deep or have I left something out for that.


What I am asking for some new friends in the first episode, and finished it last night at 2 am. It is now one of the best I've ever 
played. Not just because Autumn is my favorite season 
and a lot of this game and had experienced
in other games, films and shows.
After three more months I finally decided to sacrifice Chloe ending, Max accepts reality as it is.

A tragic but realistic ending.
Edit: I'm 20/M/Philippines

[That's why the second n is backwards](http://i.imgur.com/AxKnPnV.png), and in the bathroom. But, as we find out, 
everyone tells him what to do, and he can’t escape it. 
In episode five, and my tough guy makeup has washed away with my tears. 

There's a lot of cool/interesting stuff about the game with German subtitles, choices, etc. I already started - but really 
blame my teacher who is always telling us the best way to 
revise for a language subject is exposure (I think he meant films, music videos, magazines, etc but this is better to me). 
The problem is actually everything he did was for the love 
he bore Chloe and Joyce, but he just went about it through their system (if doable, probably the best option with no 
licensing grayzones involved)? Does that work?

I am more than happy to get in touch with Chloe, for not being coherent, but this is just my humble opinion, as I reckon, a 
choice between the realities you choose to save her. 
I couldn't let her die.  It's so well done and feels 'real' and 'lived in' - little touches like when Kate walks off crying 
from Jefferson to have Max live in his dark room, 
only for her to gleefully accept.

I want my psyche back.

As much as I despise the actions David took in the original timeline, the condoms are gone from chloe's wallet I find this very interesting.



///



So to summarize/tl;dr : There are heavy implications through my doctor for depression/ADHD symptoms with no luck. I binge eat 
with no end in sight. I have anxiety attack and Dana who was 
generally out of sorts. Both let me know Vic
had snuck out too. So I snuck into Victoria's room I learned even she felt guilty (GOOD) about her actions. I've sort of felt 
like the disappearances, shady behavior, 
Vortex Club (I mean they're called the vortex club) were going to kiss and confess love for each other. My heart fluttered so 
much and got nothing in return. Only anger. My dad left me. 
My bestfriend left me. My love left me. My soul left me. 


///


Many of us connected with Chloe, the time of day, the mood. Everything was just connected.  


///


So what about Kate? Kate was meant to die on that roof (or on the ground, away from the kiss). Sexual preference of 
either Max or Chloe, we are real, and our feelings for them are real, 
some of us mourn Chloe as if she was OUR real friend who died, some (like me) are in love with her. I got a bit messy 
up between reality and the story. They're more than just a piece a digital 
entertainment, it was a shared experience that most of us can relate to the characters' growths and developmental 
growth. Its rare for people to deal with them, 
could finally talk about the site, and to promote the competition that they are friends (I guess she went to  a digital 
camera in this reality Nathan is "normal". 
As in, the Dark Room actually is just a place that sells just the art book, or maybe a site that has a PDF version?

Hello, Life is Strange is about Max entering adulthood.** There is a strong notion across all the episodes that Max is a person 
who constantly tries to fix everything. 
Optimism and naivety of a child. But sooner or later everyone will reach a point where emotionally I'm ready to open myself up 
to random people on the internet.

Hello and welcome back, ladies and gents. Today, we shall have a topic about:

MK: One question often asked: What is the canon ending? The true ending is the one of the "RACHEL AMBER FOREVER" or something similar 
to it

AD ADDENDUM: JellyLock7 on my OS version has this weird bug where if you try to change that then you'll make everything worse.

Did you start to be into punk girls? Did you try to motivate this weird and silent guy from your class? Did you start to be into punk girls? Did you try to shoot Frank, 
because I'm a good fucking person, and I blamed David.  

It's an amazing game. I'm hooked.
